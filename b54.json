Why buying a home in urban India feels financially draining", "content": "Many Indians, who want to own a house in urban areas, find it difficult to stretch their pockets and buy a decent accommodation due to increasing cost of the real estate in the country. This leads to a pertinent question- Why are homes in India so expensive?&nbsp;In a viral LinkedIn post, investment banker Sarthak Ahuja draws comparisons with global cities like New York, highlighting how a cocktail of regulatory constraints, market manipulation, and wealth concentration is keeping urban real estate prices sky-high.&nbsp;According to Ahuja, who is a partner at Sandeep Ahuja & Co, the Price to Income (P2I) ratio in Indian cities has reached a staggering 11, implying that it would take 11 years of a person&rsquo;s entire income to afford a house. For context, this is comparable to New York, one of the world&rsquo;s priciest real estate markets.&nbsp;&quot;Assuming half your income goes toward expenses, it would take over 20 years of savings just to afford a home,&quot; Ahuja points out.&nbsp;Also Read: How to invest in an uncertain market? Here is a defensive strategy by KIE&nbsp;Why are prices so high?&nbsp;Ahuja outlines three key factors&nbsp;Low floor space index (FSI):&nbsp;Indian metros typically allow FSIs ranging from 1.3 to 3.5, limiting vertical development. In contrast, cities like New York and Singapore permit FSIs of 15 and 25, respectively, allowing developers to build taller structures and house more people in less land. This lack of vertical growth in Indian cities artificially limits supply.&nbsp;Artificial scarcity by developers:&nbsp;Real estate developers often release only a fraction of units in new projects initially, typically just 5 out of 100. They then hike prices by 10 per cent for the next release to test market appetite, perpetuating a cycle of scarcity and price inflation.&nbsp;Black money and wealth concentration:&nbsp;&ldquo;It is said that less than 10 families own 20 per cent of the land in Mumbai,&rdquo; notes Ahuja, underscoring how India&rsquo;s wealthy elite use real estate to park black money. With much of their paper wealth locked in equity, real estate offers a tangible and tax-efficient asset class, further driving up demand and prices.&nbsp;So, should you still buy it?&nbsp;Ahuja recommends a conservative approach:&nbsp;Only consider buying a home if you can pay at least 50 per cent upfront and balance 50 per cent is financed through loan.&nbsp;Ensure your EMI doesn&rsquo;t exceed 35 per cent of your monthly take-home income.&nbsp;If that&rsquo;s not feasible, he suggests renting and focusing on increasing your active income. For those set on ownership, Tier-2 cities may offer better affordability and long-term value.&nbsp;Ahuja&rsquo;s post has struck a chord with many Indians navigating the real estate labyrinth. While urban housing remains a symbol of stability and success, the systemic issues surrounding Indian real estate call for deeper regulatory reforms and more transparent practices.&nbsp;Until then, as Ahuja succinctly puts it, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stretch yourself to buy a house just for the sake of ownership. Rent, save, invest, and grow your income first.&rdquo;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Indian housing market", "Urban Housing Crisis", "Real Estate India", "Home Buying Tips", "Property Prices", "Affordable Housing", "Personal Finance", "Why real estate is expensive in India", "urban housing crisis India", "price to income ratio Indian cities"], "date": "2025-04-08T14:20:10+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040800623", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:40:55"},

Selecting the correct ITR form is crucial for ensuring compliance with tax laws and maximising benefits.

Most senior citizens who earn from pension, interest, and one house property, and whose total income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh, can use ITR-1 (Sahaj). However, those with capital gains, income exceeding Rs 50 lakh, or income from more than one house property should opt for ITR-2. If the senior citizen has income from business or profession, ITR-3 is appropriate. Alternatively, if they are opting for presumptive taxation under Sections 44AD or 44ADA with income up to Rs 50 lakh, ITR-4 (Sugam) may apply,&rdquo; said Amit Bansal, partner, Singhania & Co.&nbsp;Sujit Sudhakar Bangar, founder, TaxBuddy.com explains where they should invest to get maximum benefit?&nbsp;When it comes to investments, safety, and steady returns are the top priorities.

Fixed deposits with a 5-year lock-in are also eligible under Section 80C.&nbsp;Budget 2025-26 has also extended tax exemption to withdrawals from certain National Savings Scheme (NSS) accounts, which improves liquidity without a tax hit. A mix of these options based on income needs and lock-in preferences is ideal. Withdrawals from National Savings Scheme accounts made on or after August 29, 2024, are exempt from tax, providing liquidity without additional tax liability.&nbsp;ALSO READ: BOB launches Square Drive FD with 7.75% interest, ends Utsav Deposit Scheme&nbsp;Naveen Wadhwa, vice-president, Taxmann explains what are the points to keep in mind for senior citizens while filing an ITR?&nbsp;One common mistake people make is failing to disclose their petty incomes, such as interest earned on a savings bank account, under the assumption that it is exempt from tax up to Rs 10,000 (Rs. 50,000 in case of senior citizens). The interest income is actually taxable, and a corresponding deduction is allowed under Section 80TTA for up to Rs. 10,000/Rs 50,000.&nbsp;Selecting the incorrect Income Tax Return (ITR) form can result in incomplete reporting of information, potentially leading to a defective income tax return. Moreover, it may trigger a notice for underreporting of income.&nbsp;Income from all bank accounts should be reported, not just the bank account in which a refund is being claimed. One should verify all credit entries in the bank statement of the relevant financial year to identify the interest, dividend, or any other income to be reported in the ITR form.&nbsp;While preparing your tax returns, it is essential to ensure that there are no discrepancies or inconsistencies, especially when it comes to the TDS credit claimed. A mismatch between the TDS credit claimed in your return and the amount reflected in your Form 26AS can lead to a notice from the income tax department to inquire about the inconsistency. To avoid any such discrepancies, it is important to cross-verify the TDS credit claimed in your return with the amount displayed in your Form 26AS before filing your tax returns.&nbsp;The option to file the Income-tax return in paper mode is available only to super senior citizens (a resident individual whose age is 80 years or more at any time during the relevant previous year), provided the return is filed in ITR 1 (Sahaj) and ITR 4 (Sugam).&nbsp;A senior citizen who is a resident Indian and whose age is 75 years or more at any time during the previous year is not required to file his ITR if his tax has been deducted under section 194P by the bank.", "keywords": ["Income Tax 2025", "ITR Form Guide", "Senior Citizens India", "Tax Filing Tips", "ITR For Seniors", "Finance For Seniors", "personal finance news"], "date": "2025-04-08T16:00:29+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040800745", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:40:57"},

The performance of debt funds has been a key indicator of this shift, signaling potential headwinds for equity markets in the coming months.&nbsp;For the first time since 2011, debt funds are seeing a 1-year rolling period outperform equity funds, and the underperformance of equity funds in February 2025, which reached 4.7%, marks the largest gap since 2018. Historically, such periods of underperformance in equity funds have been followed by multiple rounds of correction in the stock market, suggesting that a similar phase may be underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the concern is a growing trend of underperformance in active funds compared to passive funds. Active strategies, which typically involve more flexibility and active management, have struggled to keep pace with the more stable and predictable passive funds. This marks the first significant instance of active funds underperforming since 2023, with earlier periods of similar performance seen in 2011-2014 and 2018-2020. During those phases, large-cap stocks, especially those within the Nifty Top-10, led the market&#39;s outperformance. This trend could be another indicator of a weakening equity environment.&nbsp;Shift Back to Larger Names and Weaker Market Breadth&nbsp;&nbsp;Further signs of a deteriorating equity environment are emerging with the shift in index weights back to larger names in the market. The weight of the top 50 stocks in the NSE500 index has been steadily increasing since May 2020, indicating a growing preference for larger companies over smaller ones. This trend of market polarization is often a leading indicator of weak economic or earnings growth ahead. Historically, such phases of market polarization have been accompanied by weak market breadth and sideways or correcting markets, which signals that investors may want to reallocate funds towards large-cap stocks to avoid further underperformance.&nbsp;This shift is reminiscent of previous market downturns, including those seen in 2008-2009, 2010-2013, and 2018-2020, when smaller companies underperformed, and liquidity in mid and small-cap stocks faded. As this trend continues, it suggests that investors should be cautious about smaller-cap stocks, which could face additional pressure as liquidity dries up.&nbsp;Addition of new folios&ndash; Smallcap folio addition rate drops to 2-year low. Midcap & Thematic also plunge&nbsp;Rate of new folio addition in Mutual funds gives an indication of the breadth of Retail participation. While flows will be influenced by the size of the investor, new folio addition will be a better reflection of breadth of investor participation.&nbsp;&quot;In Feb&rsquo;25, Equity funds saw addition of 1.8 million folios, which is the slowest monthly addition since November 2023. This was largely on back of slowest folio addition in Midcap, Smallcap and Thematic/Sectoral funds. What is more concerning is that bulk of new investors in Midcap and Thematic/Sectoral funds came into markets post election results of June 2024. And a meaningful portion of these investors are already sitting on losses. Although, we have still not seen much impact on flows, these could be initial leads of flows turning weak going ahead,&quot; said Sunil Jain of Elara Capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means: Of concern is the fact that many of the new investors in mid-cap and thematic funds entered the market after the June 2024 election results and are now sitting on losses, indicating that investor sentiment may be weakening.&nbsp; Cash levels surge: &nbsp; Another worrying sign for equity markets is the sharp increase in cash levels held by fund managers, particularly in mid-cap and small-cap funds. Cash levels in large-cap schemes have expanded to 4.8%, the highest since June 2023, while mid-cap and small-cap funds have seen similar increases. The total cash held across all active equity schemes now stands at Rs1.74 trillion ($20 billion). Rising cash levels as a percentage of free-float market cap reflect a lack of conviction among fund managers, potentially due to fears of further market declines and a slowdown in retail flows.Changes in Mutual Fund Allocation and increased focus on large caps &nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual fund allocations change &nbsp; In line with these developments, mutual fund allocation is also starting to shift, particularly in the Flexicap schemes, which allow more flexibility in investing across market caps. These schemes have seen a slight reduction in their allocation to small-cap stocks, now holding 10.5% of their assets in small caps, down from 12% in October 2024. This is a significant trend as Flexicap funds are typically seen as a bellwether for investor sentiment. As the allocation to small-cap stocks decreases, the focus is shifting more toward large-cap stocks, suggesting that fund managers are preparing for continued market uncertainty.&nbsp;Signs of Domestic Panic in the Market&nbsp;Finally, one of the most telling indicators of potential market instability is the rising percentage of equity schemes hitting their 52-week lows. Historically, such spikes have been an early sign of a larger market downtrend. In March 2025, the percentage of equity schemes hitting their 52-week lows surged to 45%, signaling an initial panic among investors. Previous cycles, such as in 2008, 2011, and 2018, saw similar spikes followed by more significant corrections. If this trend continues, the market may experience a deeper sell-off in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Debt funds", "mutual funds", "accrual funds", "equity funds", "market correction"], "date": "2025-03-25T12:34:46+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125032500412", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:40:58"},

With AAP seeking a third consecutive term, the BJP aiming to regain control, and Congress attempting a revival, the contest is expected to be intense.&nbsp;With multiple political parties battling for dominance, there is a possibility that no single party or alliance may secure an absolute majority. In such a case, Delhi could face a hung assembly - a situation where no party has enough seats to form a government on its own.&nbsp;What is a hung assembly?A hung assembly occurs when no political party or alliance wins more than half the seats required to form a government. In Delhi&rsquo;s case, with 70 assembly seats, a party or alliance needs at least 36 seats for a simple majority. If no party reaches this number, the responsibility to form a government falls on the Lieutenant Governor, who follows a specific process:&nbsp;1. Inviting the single-largest party&nbsp;The Lt Governor invites the leader of the party with the most seats to form the government. The party is given around 10 days to prove its majority by securing support from other parties or independent MLAs.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi Assembly election results 2025: Date, time, when and where to watch&nbsp;2. Seeking external support&nbsp;If a party lacks a majority, it can seek external support from other parties without forming a formal alliance. The party offering external support does not usually hold ministerial positions, making the government fragile and vulnerable to collapse.&nbsp;3. Dissolution and re-election&nbsp;If no party can prove a majority within the given timeframe, the Lt Governor dissolves the assembly and calls for fresh elections.&nbsp;What is a minority government?A minority government forms when a party governs despite having fewer than the required majority. In such cases:&nbsp;The ruling party must rely on external parties for legislative support.&nbsp;It struggles to pass laws unless opposition parties abstain or vote in its favour.&nbsp;These governments are unstable and often fail to complete their full term.&nbsp;Delhi elections 2025: Will there be a hung assembly?While most exit polls predicted a BJP victory, the AAP dismissed them, citing past instances where pollsters underestimated its performance. If neither party secures a clear majority, Delhi could face a period of political uncertainty, with negotiations and alliances playing a crucial role in determining the next government.&nbsp;What do the exit polls say?A total of 10 exit polls were released on Wednesday night after polls closed, with seven forecasting a decisive victory for the BJP. The most optimistic projections came from People&#39;s Pulse, Poll Diary, and People&#39;s Insights, predicting BJP could secure anywhere between 40 to 60 seats.&nbsp;Delhi Assembly elections: Most exit polls give BJP clear edge over AAP&nbsp;Axis My India estimated a BJP victory on 45-55 seats. Today&#39;s Chanakya, another major pollster, placed BJP at 51 seats, with AAP trailing at 19. Across the board, Congress was given little to no chance, with most exit polls predicting it would struggle to win even a single seat.&nbsp;Chanakya Strategies, DV Research, JVC, and P-Marq also forecasted BJP as the winner.&nbsp;Exit polls vs reality: Delhi elections 2015, 2020Exit polls have historically struggled to predict AAP&rsquo;s performance in Delhi.&nbsp;2015: Exit polls underestimated AAP&rsquo;s dominance. The average of six major exit polls predicted AAP would win around 45 seats, but the party ended up securing a landslide victory with 67 out of 70 seats. BJP won just three, while Congress was wiped out.&nbsp;2020: Forecasts improved but still fell short of reality. The average of eight exit polls projected AAP would win 54 seats, while BJP was expected to get 15.

He submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at the Raj Bhavan. This decision followed escalating tensions and persistent unrest in the northeastern state, which had already claimed hundreds of lives over the past two years.&nbsp;Singh had assumed office as the Chief Minister of Manipur for the first time in 2017.&nbsp;What did Biren Singh&rsquo;s resignation say?&nbsp;In his resignation letter, Biren Singh expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve the people of Manipur and thanked the central government for its timely interventions. &ldquo;It has been an honour to serve the people of Manipur thus far. I am extremely grateful to the central government for timely actions, interventions, developmental work and implementation of various projects for safeguarding the interest of every single Manipuri,&rdquo; he said in his resignation letter.&nbsp;Was Biren Singh losing support among MLAs?News agency PTI reported that Biren Singh had been losing support among BJP MLAs, with several of them meeting party leaders in Delhi to voice their concerns. Despite this, BJP Manipur President A Sharda Devi denied any discord, stating that Biren&#39;s resignation was for the state&#39;s future. She said that his resignation was motivated by a desire for peace and that he had called for the Centre&rsquo;s continued support to ensure the safety of the people.&nbsp;Opposition calls for no-confidence motionOpposition parties had been demanding Singh&rsquo;s resignation for his failure to address the ongoing violence. Following Singh&rsquo;s resignation, Congress&rsquo;s Manipur President Keisham Meghachandra announced plans to move a no-confidence motion in the state Assembly.&nbsp;The Opposition also called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Manipur to assess the situation. This demand was echoed by Trinamool Congress leader Derek O&rsquo;Brien, who criticised the PM&rsquo;s speech in Parliament for omitting key issues, including the violence in Manipur.&nbsp;Manipur ethnic clashesManipur has been witnessing violent clashes between the valley-based Meitei community and the Kuki-Zo groups. The violence, which began in May 2023, has led to the deaths of over 250 people and displaced thousands. The conflict was sparked by a demand from the Meitei community for Scheduled Tribe status, leading to protests and clashes.&nbsp;Social media videos from the region showed the devastating effects of the violence, including burned homes and disturbing images of sexual harassment. Prominent figures, including boxer MC Mary Kom, have called for peace and security in the state.&nbsp;Biren Singh&rsquo;s role in the ethnic violenceThe controversy surrounding Singh deepened when the Supreme Court sought a forensic report regarding leaked audio clips. These clips allegedly contained conversations suggesting that Singh had allowed Meitei groups to loot arms during the unrest.&nbsp;The Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHUR) called for a court-monitored investigation into the allegations, claiming that Singh played a central role in organising and inciting violence against Kuki-dominated areas.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s next for Manipur state?With Singh&rsquo;s resignation, speculation has risen about the possibility of President&rsquo;s Rule in the state. While the governor has accepted Singh&rsquo;s resignation, he has asked him to continue in office until a successor is appointed.&nbsp;The ruling BJP is expected to hold meetings to finalise a new Chief Minister. The Manipur Assembly&#39;s Budget session, scheduled to begin on February 10, has been suspended until a new leader is in place.&nbsp;President&rsquo;s Rule in Manipur?The imposition of President&rsquo;s Rule in Manipur could be considered under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, which allows the President to take action when a state government fails to comply with constitutional provisions. The decision would follow advice from the Union Council of Ministers.&nbsp;The Article 356 reads, &ldquo;Where any State has failed to comply with, or to give effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.&rdquo;&nbsp;Several conditions must be met before the President can impose President&#39;s Rule in a state. These include:&nbsp; 1. The President must be convinced that the governance of the state can no longer be carried out in accordance with the Constitution.2. The state government fails to elect a new chief minister within the time frame set by the state&rsquo;s governor.3. A coalition breakdown occurs, resulting in the chief minister losing majority support in the legislature, and the CM is unable to prove majority within the prescribed period.4. The assembly loses its majority due to a no-confidence vote.5. Elections are delayed due to extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters, war, or an epidemic.&nbsp;What will happen once President&rsquo;s Rule is imposed?Once President&rsquo;s Rule is imposed, the governor assumes the administration of the state on behalf of the President, working with the Chief Secretary and other appointed advisors or administrators. The President can also declare that the powers of the state legislature will be exercised by Parliament.&nbsp;Under this rule, the state legislative assembly may either be suspended or dissolved. Additionally, when Parliament is not in session, the President has the authority to issue ordinances related to the state&#39;s administration.&nbsp;When is the President&rsquo;s Rule revoked?President&rsquo;s Rule can be revoked at any time through a subsequent proclamation by the President.

This change is expected to impact thousands of non-immigrant visa holders, including those on H-1B, F-1, and B1/B2 visas.&nbsp;While the US embassy in India has not confirmed the change, Atlys, an online visa processing platform, said it updated its eligibility criteria in the past week.&nbsp;&quot;Although there hasn&#39;t been any official announcement, the change is now being enforced and applications that have expired for more than 12 months are no longer accepted,&quot; an Atlys spokesperson told Business Standard.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s changed?&nbsp;Previously, individuals could renew their visas using the dropbox system if their previous visa had expired within the past 48 months. This extended policy was introduced during the pandemic to ease consular backlogs. The latest change means many applicants will now have to appear for in-person interviews, which could further strain the visa system.&nbsp;According to The National Law Review, this shift will likely cause delays and travel disruptions for non-immigrant visa holders, including those on:&nbsp;H-1B &ndash; a work visa for skilled professionals in specialised fields, requiring a job offer from a US employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;F-1 &ndash; a student visa for academic programmes in the US, allowing limited on-campus employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;B1/B2 &ndash; a short-term visa for business (B1) or tourism (B2), which does not permit employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;L-1 &ndash; a visa for employees transferring within a multinational company to a US office, applicable to executives, managers, or specialised knowledge workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;O-1 &ndash; a visa for individuals with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed?&nbsp;Applicants now qualify for the dropbox process only if their visa expired within the past 12 months and is in the same category. Those who do not meet this requirement must schedule an in-person interview, which may lead to:&nbsp;&lt; Increased demand for in-person appointments at US consulates&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Longer wait times for visa interviews, particularly in high-volume cities&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Possible disruptions for business travellers and professionals requiring swift renewals&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; The change is also expected to impact Indian students in the US.&nbsp;Siddharth Iyer, chief operating officer at OneStep Global, told Business Standard, &quot;The recent policy shift in the US visa renewal process for students (F-1) represents a significant adjustment, particularly for applicants in India. With the eligibility for interview waivers now reduced to 12 months from the previous 48 months, some students may experience longer wait times and additional steps when renewing their visas. While this adjustment reflects a return to pre-pandemic regulations, it comes at a time when demand for international education is high.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;This change aims to streamline the process, but it could pose challenges for students who fall outside the updated eligibility window. However, it&#39;s important to note that many students will still have ample opportunities to renew their visas through the regular process,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who are affected by this change should stay informed, plan their renewals well in advance, and continue to reach out to their university&rsquo;s international offices or visa consultants for guidance.&quot;&nbsp;Visa appointment delays in India&nbsp;Getting a visa appointment in India is already a lengthy process.

The protest, organised by members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), took place in front of Kempegowda Metro Station on Friday afternoon, following up to 100 per cent fare hikes of Namma Metro.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s what is known about the fare hike, protests, and resolution.&nbsp;Bengaluru metro hikes fare, removes discountsOn February 9, 2025, BMRCL announced increase in travel fares of Namma Metro, Bengaluru&rsquo;s metro system.The fare adjustments include an increase in the maximum fare to Rs 90 from Rs 60, while the minimum fare for journeys covering the shortest distance (0-2 km) remained unchanged at Rs 10.&nbsp;However, fares for other distances, such as those between 2-4 km and for routes longer than 30 km, had risen by Rs 5-Rs 30. In addition, discounts previously available to QR code users had been removed, with only smart card users receiving a reduced discount of 5 per cent.&nbsp;The minimum balance for smart cards were raised to Rs 90 from Rs 50, while off-peak travel during certain hours offers an additional 5 per cent discount.&nbsp;Why were the metro fares hiked?This fare hike was the first in seven years for the city&rsquo;s metro system. The BMRCL justified the fare revision by citing a report from the fare fixation committee (FFC), which was formed in 2024 by the Union government. The committee, led by a former High Court judge, recommended fare increases based on operational costs, feedback from passengers, and expert consultations.&nbsp;Congress, BJP blame each other for fare hikeThe fare revision, which led to price hikes of up to 100 per cent in some cases, triggered strong reactions from commuters, politicians, and mobility experts. The fare changes also led to heated debates, with political parties accusing each other of responsibility and a public outcry over the impact on daily passengers.&nbsp;The Congress and the Opposition BJP exchanged blame, with both parties accusing the other of influencing the decision for the far hike.&nbsp;BJP leaders, including Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya, demanded a rollback, while condemning the Congress-led state government for burdening citizens with the fare increase. Meanwhile, the Congress pointed to the BJP-led central government, claiming that the fare hike was a result of recommendations from the central government&rsquo;s fare fixation committee.&nbsp;CM Siddaramaiah calls for rollback on faresFollowing public outcry, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on February 14 directed the BMRCL to reduce fares where the increases were excessive.&nbsp;Siddaramaiah had initially claimed that the state government had no control over the fare revision, as BMRCL operates as a joint venture between the Centre and the State. However, as pressures mounted he called a rollback on certain fares, calling the hike &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo;.&nbsp;On the same day, BMRCL announced a fare revision, capping the maximum hike at 71 per cent and offering reductions for certain routes. The new fare structure, which took effect on February 14, 2025, was intended to address commuter concerns while still adhering to the original recommendations of the fare fixation committee.&nbsp;Protests outside Bengaluru metroDespite the rollback, discontent continued among the public with ABVP organising protests outside the metro stations.&nbsp;The Cottonpet police initiated a suo motu case after receiving complaints regarding the protest.&nbsp;Authorities informed the protesters that the Karnataka High Court&rsquo;s March 3, 2022, order prohibits demonstrations and processions outside Freedom Park. Despite this, the activists allegedly ignored the court&rsquo;s directive and continued their protest. Following the escalation, senior police officers were notified, and additional police forces were deployed from Cottonpet and Upparpet stations.&nbsp;The protesters were subsequently detained. The FIR has been filed under various sections of the Karnataka Police Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including Section 189 (unlawful assembly), Section 190 (holding unlawful assembly members accountable for collective offenses), and Section 223 (disobedience of public orders).&nbsp;[With agency inputs]&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Bengaluru metro fare hike", "Namma Metro fare increase 2025", "Bengaluru metro protests", "BMRCL fare revision", "metro fare fixation committee India", "Bengaluru metro QR code discount removal", "Karnataka government metro fare rollback", "ABVP protests metro fare", "Bengaluru metro price increase", "CM Siddaramaiah metro fare decision", "Congress BJP blame game metro", "Karnataka High Court protest ban", "Bengaluru metro travel cost", "BMRCL smart card fare discount", "Bengaluru metro commuter outrage", "Bengaluru metro price hike", "bengaluru metro commuters news", "Bengaluru metro news today"], "date": "2025-02-17T14:12:03+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021700421", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:02"},

The latest row erupted after the Centre withheld Rs 2,150 crore meant for Tamil Nadu after the MK Stalin-led government refused to implement the NEP in the state.&nbsp;According to Chief Minister MK Stalin, the opposition to the NEP was not merely due to the &quot;attempt to impose Hindi&quot; but also because of factors that would have serious consequences for the future of students and the social justice system.&nbsp;Here&#39;s explaining why Tamil Nadu is opposed to NEP:&nbsp;Core concerns&nbsp;1. Three-language formula: The NEP 2020 recommends a three-language formula, suggesting that students learn three languages, with at least two being native to India. Tamil Nadu has historically adhered to a two-language policy, teaching only Tamil and English in schools. The state perceives the introduction of a third language as an attempt to impose Hindi, which has been a sensitive issue since the anti-Hindi agitations of the 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK have expressed strong reservations against this aspect of the NEP, emphasising the importance of preserving Tamil linguistic heritage and opposing any form of Hindi imposition.&nbsp;2. Centralisation and state autonomy: Tamil Nadu argues that the NEP&#39;s framework undermines the state&#39;s autonomy over its educational policies. Education in India is a concurrent subject, allowing both the state and central governments to legislate on it. The state contends that the NEP imposes a uniform national policy that doesn&#39;t account for regional socio-economic and cultural differences, thereby infringing upon the state&#39;s rights to tailor education to its unique context.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Four-year undergraduate programme: The NEP proposes restructuring undergraduate programmes into a four-year course with multiple exit options, allowing students to leave with a certificate after one year, a diploma after two years, or a degree after completing the full program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics in Tamil Nadu fear that this structure may lead to increased dropout rates, as students might opt for early exit points, thereby affecting the quality and depth of higher education. Also, there are concerns about the state&#39;s readiness in terms of infrastructure and faculty to implement such a system effectively.&nbsp;4. Common entrance exams: Tamil Nadu strongly opposes the entrance exam policies under NEP 2020, particularly CUET and NEET, arguing that they disadvantage state-board students and undermine social justice. The state rejects CUET for university admissions, claiming it favours CBSE students and increases reliance on coaching centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Centre withhold funds for Tamil Nadu?&nbsp;The Centre&#39;s decision to link the release of funds under schemes like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to the implementation of the NEP has intensified the controversy. Tamil Nadu alleges that over Rs 2,150 crore in SSA funds have been withheld because of its refusal to adopt the NEP and the three-language policy.&nbsp;According to MK Stalin, the implementation of NEP will push Tamil Nadu back by 2000 years. &quot;The Centre says Tamil Nadu will get Rs 2,000 crore if the state implements the NEP. I wish to say that we will not agree to the NEP even if the Centre offers Rs 10,000 crore. I will not allow the NEP and commit the sin of pushing Tamil Nadu backward by 2,000 years,&quot; Stalin said.&nbsp;Stalin also wrote to PM Modi, asking him to help release Rs 2,152 crore in Samagra Shiksha funds for the state. He requested that the funds not be linked to the implementation of NEP 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Centre&#39;s stand?&nbsp;Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called out the DMK government&#39;s stand, saying that Stalin&rsquo;s letter to the PM goes against the idea of cooperative federalism.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tamil Nadu has always been a torchbearer of social and educational progress, pioneering some of the most transformative reforms in India. However, the continued opposition to the NEP 2020 for political reasons deprives students, teachers, and educational institutions in Tamil Nadu of the immense opportunities and resources that this policy offers. The policy is designed to be flexible, allowing states to customise its implementation to suit their unique educational needs,&rdquo; Pradhan wrote in response.", "keywords": ["tamil nadu new education policy", "tamil nadu nep", "tamil nadu nep opposition stalin", "tamil nadu nep rejection", "why tamil nadu oppose nep", "mk stalin nep", "tamil nadu hindi imposition", "dravidian politics"], "date": "2025-02-23T16:04:51+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022300382", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:05"},

Industry executives argue that the deadline is impractical,&nbsp;highlighting challenges such as recycling infrastructure, material shortages, and cost concerns, especially with peak summer demand approaching, according to a report by&nbsp;The Economic Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverage giants including Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co, Bisleri, and Parle Agro are all impacted by these stringent deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued this directive over two years ago as part of India&rsquo;s Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules. However, beverage companies contend that the industry is not adequately prepared for the transition, despite the extended timeline.&nbsp;PET vs rPET bottlesPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, and rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) are both widely used in packaging and textiles, but they differ significantly in their environmental impact and production process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PET is a durable, lightweight plastic commonly found in beverage bottles, food containers, and synthetic fibres. Its strength and recyclability make it a popular choice, but it is primarily produced from fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, making its manufacturing process resource-intensive and environmentally demanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, rPET is an eco-friendlier alternative derived from recycled PET products. Post-consumer PET waste, such as plastic bottles, is collected, cleaned, and processed into flakes, which are then melted and repurposed into rPET pellets or resin. These materials are used to create new products like rPET packaging, rPET sheets, and rPET polyester fabrics, reducing reliance on virgin plastics and minimising waste.&nbsp;What is the govt mandate on PET bottles?To incentivise domestic recycling, India banned the import of plastic waste, including PET bottles in 2015. By 2016, however, the ban was amended, allowing plastic waste imports only for units located in special economic zones (SEZs).&nbsp;The Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 banned plastic sachets used for gutkha, tobacco, and pan masala due to high littering potential. Additionally, states/UTs were asked to form special task forces for eliminating single-use plastics (SUPs).&nbsp;Plastic packaging producers, e-commerce firms, and major SUPs users were directed to phase out SUPs. Compliance varied by state/UT, with some implementing partial bans while others enforced a complete ban.&nbsp;In 2019, the Environment Ministry imposed a full ban on plastic waste imports to strengthen India&rsquo;s waste management system and prevent the country from becoming a dumping ground. The Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Smriti Manch (PDUSM) campaign played a role in advocating for this decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;India allows PET waste imports&nbsp;The ban on PET bottle imports was lifted in 2021 after industries processing plastic waste reported shortages in India. Seven Indian companies applied to import 93,000 tonnes of PET bottle waste from the US, Canada, and Germany, citing insufficient domestic supply.&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change mandates that beverage makers use 30 per cent recycled plastic in rigid packaging, like PET bottles, starting April 1, 2025 with annual increases of 10 per cent to reach 60 per cent by financial year 2027-28 to 2028-29.&nbsp;Industry urges govt to adopt &lsquo;realistic targets&rsquo;Industry representatives, during a December meeting with the Central Pollution Control Board, argued that the 30 per cent threshold is too stringent due to the scarcity of rPET and urged the government to adopt more realistic targets, suggesting an initial 15 per cent obligation with gradual 5 per cent annual increases, the Hindu Bussinessline had earlier reported.&nbsp;Industry leaders say that despite ongoing investments, recycling capacity expansion takes 2-3 years. At present, only five Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)-approved plants are equipped to produce food-grade rPET, meeting just 15 per cent of industry demand.&nbsp;Affordability and regulatory concernsThe industry fears that bottling costs will surge by nearly 30 per cent, a portion of which may be passed on to consumers. Smaller companies, lacking resources to procure certified rPET, may resort to lower-quality recyclers, raising safety and regulatory concerns.&nbsp;Another challenge is that plastic bottles account for 70 per cent of beverage packaging, making them the most widely used option due to lower transport costs compared to glass and affordability over aluminium cans. The sudden shift to higher rPET content without sufficient infrastructure could disrupt supply chains.&nbsp;Govt response and legal issuesCiting officials, The Economic Times reported that the government is unlikely to extend the deadline, citing that companies have had sufficient time to comply. Industry executives, however, believe the rigid timeline could force them to seek an anticipatory stay in court, delaying implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["beverage giants", "india rpet bottle mandate", "rpet deadline April 2025", "Beverage companies PET bottles", "Indian beverage companies recycled PET bottles", "Indian government recycled PET bottles"], "date": "2025-02-26T11:36:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022600258", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:05"},

Here&rsquo;s a look at the top countries that offer the most promising opportunities for individuals seeking a global advantage.&nbsp; Top Investment Migration Program Options to Access the World&rsquo;s Best Opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;As competition for talent intensifies across the globe, the 2025 Henley Opportunity Index emphasizes the growing importance of investment migration as a strategy for securing a brighter future. With a focus on education, career growth, earning potential, and economic mobility, the report reveals that countries offering structured pathways to residency and citizenship are becoming increasingly sought after by families who view strategic relocation as key to wealth planning and career advancement.&nbsp;&quot;&ldquo;While studies confirm that tertiary graduates earn around 50% more than those with only secondary education, research also reveals that over two-thirds of income disparity worldwide is dictated by the country in which an individual lives and works. With barriers to opportunity often dictated by the limitations of our citizenship, the index makes a compelling case for investment migration as a game-changing strategy for families looking to transcend the constraints of their &lsquo;birthright lottery&rsquo;&quot; said Tess Wilkinson, Director of Henley & Partners Education.&nbsp;The Singapore Global Investor Program is popular among ultra-high-net-worth families, and the city-state is well-established as a world-class education destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, with its EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program offering an efficient route to permanent resident status and new &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; visa proposed, which would offer wealthy investors the right to live and work in the US and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment, is not far behind on 78%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia, which recently launched a new National Innovation Visa, comes in next with 76%, ahead of Canada, which offers a popular Start-Up Visa Program for entrepreneurs and scores 73%, rounding up the Top 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK, which has an Innovator Founder Visa requiring individuals to set up a new, scaling business in the country, secures an opportunity score of 70% when it comes to providing strategic advantage to its citizens and residents, and the UAE, which has numerous categories of beneficiaries for its Golden Residence visa, earns 67%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Austria, which requires a substantial contribution to its economy to secure citizenship, and New Zealand, which recently eased the rules for its Active Investor Plus Visa Program to incentivize investors, each achieve 65%, closely followed by Italy, which also offers an Investor Visa and scores 64% on the Henley Opportunity Index.&nbsp;Further down the list evaluating the possibility of future success is the cosmopolitan wealth hub of Hong Kong, which reintroduced its Capital Investment Entrant Scheme in 2024 and scores 61%, just ahead of rising star Latvia, whose residence by investment offering is one of the fastest and most competitive programs in Europe and scores 60%.&nbsp; Next is Malta, which offers an attractive pathway that allows for the granting of citizenship by a certificate of naturalization to foreign individuals and their families who contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic development, scoring 59%.&nbsp; Hungary, which offers a Guest Investor Residence Permit, follows with an opportunity score of 58%. Greece and Portugal, both scoring 56%, round out the rankings, with Greece&rsquo;s Golden Visa Program shooting up in popularity in the past 12 months, while Portugal&rsquo;s Golden Residence Permit Program has long been favored by investors from across the globe.&nbsp;&quot;By investing in these residence and citizenship programs, families can permanently relocate to regions that offer exceptional educational opportunities, professional development, and high-quality living standards. This significantly enhances earning potential and facilitates wealth creation across generations,&quot; said Wilkinson.&nbsp;&nbsp;She explains this with the following examples:&nbsp;A Vietnamese family with an opportunity score of just 29% in their home country could elevate their next generation&rsquo;s potential success to 78% by securing US residence through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. Similarly, an Indian family with a 37% score could boost their advantage to 84% by relocating to Switzerland via the Swiss Residence Program. In another example, a Nigerian family with a mere 21% opportunity score could dramatically increase their life chances to 79% by obtaining residence through Singapore&rsquo;s Global Investor Program, securing a remarkable advantage. Additionally, investment migration routes such as the UAE&rsquo;s Golden Visa and New Zealand&rsquo;s Active Investor Plus Visa offer next-generation opportunity advantages of 67% and 65%, respectively.&nbsp;&quot;Filipino investors leveraging Canada&rsquo;s Start-Up Visa Program would experience significant improvements in multiple aspects of their lives. Access to premium education would see a rise from a score of 32 out of 100 in the Philippines to 73 in Canada. Earning potential would also grow substantially, improving from 34 to 66. Career advancement opportunities would witness an even greater jump, surging from 35 to 74.

Here is a closer examination of the industrial competition in China and how &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; comes into play.&nbsp;What is Neijuan?The term &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; best translates to &lsquo;involution&rsquo; and can be better understood as &lsquo;involutionary competition&rsquo;. It describes a cycle of diminishing returns caused by intense competition. In simple terms, it means companies and individuals are forced to work harder and invest more, without seeing proportional benefits or returns.&nbsp;In business, this means companies slashing prices and overproducing to stay ahead, even if it hurts profitability.&nbsp;For workers, it describes a relentless rat race where individuals must continuously upskill, work long hours, and compete fiercely &ndash; without necessarily improving their quality of life.&nbsp;Chinese crack down on NeijuanNeijuan has been particularly visible in China&rsquo;s booming industries, where companies are undercutting each other in price wars, leading to lower profits and unsustainable business practices.

Arora, founder and chief investment officer of Helios Capital, voiced his concerns at the Business Standard Manthan Summit 2025, arguing that the tax policy is discouraging foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and driving them away from Indian markets.&nbsp;But why is it causing investor concerns? To grasp the issue, it&rsquo;s important to understand what capital gains tax is and how it works.&nbsp;What is capital gains tax?When individuals or entities sell certain capital assets &ndash; such as stocks, mutual funds, property, gold, or other investments &ndash; they make a capital gain (profit) on the sale. If these assets were held for over a year, the profit is classified as a long-term capital gain and is taxed accordingly.&nbsp;What are the types of capital gains tax?Capital gains tax is categorised into short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG), depending on the holding period of the asset.&nbsp;Short-term capital gains (STCG): This tax applies when an asset is sold within a short duration after purchase. It is generally taxed at a higher rate.&nbsp;Long-term capital gains (LTCG): This tax applies when an asset is held for an extended period before being sold. It is typically taxed at a lower rate to encourage long-term investment.&nbsp;What is the STCG in India?STCG apply when assets like stocks, mutual funds, real estate, or other capital assets are sold within a short holding period &mdash; typically less than one year for equities and less than two years for real estate.&nbsp;In India, STCG on equity-oriented investments (where Securities Transaction Tax is paid) is taxed at 15 per cent, while STCG from other assets is taxed as per the investor&rsquo;s income tax slab rate.&nbsp;How to calculate STCG?Short-term capital gains (STCG) are calculated by subtracting the cost of acquisition, cost of improvement (if any), and any expenses related to the sale from the selling price of the asset. The formula is:STCG = Sale Price &ndash; (Purchase Price + Improvement Cost + Transfer Expenses)&nbsp;What is the LTCG in India?In India, LTCG on stocks and equity-oriented mutual funds is taxed at 12.5 per cent (plus surcharge and cess) for profits exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per year. However, LTCG was not applicable on equity until 2018 for gains up to Rs 1 lakh.&nbsp;The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced a major shift in capital gains taxation, increasing the LTCG tax rate to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent and eliminating the indexation benefit that previously allowed investors to adjust the purchase price of assets for inflation.&nbsp;Last year&rsquo;s Budget also called for equal tax treatment for foreign and domestic investors. There are no changes to the taxation of long-term capital gains (LTCG) derived from residential property in the new Income Tax Bill 2025.&nbsp;How to calculate LTCGThe taxable amount under LTCG is determined by subtracting the cost of acquisition from the sale price, and in the case of property or other high-value assets, certain transaction costs like brokerage or legal fees can be deducted before applying the tax.&nbsp;Why are investors worried?The elimination of indexation benefits has been particularly controversial. Previously, indexation allowed taxpayers to adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, effectively reducing taxable gains. By removing this benefit, the new tax structure could increase the tax burden on investors, especially those selling property, gold, and unlisted assets.&nbsp;Foreign investors, in particular, have been hit hard by these changes. Speaking at the Business Standard annual summit Arora of Helios Capital argued that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) &ndash; which form a significant portion of foreign investment &ndash; are now disincentivised from investing in India.&nbsp;&ldquo;The biggest mistake they (the government) have made, the biggest souring of sentiment, and reality which they have to accept is capital gains tax in India, particularly the foreign investors, is 100 per cent wrong,&rdquo; Arora said. &ldquo;The largest investors in the world and in India are foreign sovereign funds, pension funds, universities, and the HNIs. Taxing them on their gains, especially when they have no tax set-off available in their home country and when they face forex-related risks, is a big mistake that the government is making.&rdquo;&nbsp;How has this impacted the Indian market?Since October 2024, foreign investors have pulled out over Rs 2 trillion from Indian equities, according to a report by The Times of India. Several factors have contributed to this trend such as:&gt;Higher capital gains tax rates making Indian investments less appealing.&gt;Weak corporate earnings growth reducing investor confidence.&gt;The falling rupee, which erodes returns when converted back to foreign currencies.&gt;Stronger US markets, where higher bond yields and lower tax burdens offer better returns.&nbsp;Arora had also mentioned that the Indian government had earned $10-11 billion dollars as capital gains tax in 2022-23 (FY23).&nbsp;How does India&rsquo;s capital gains tax compare to other countries?Australia: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable if an asset is held for more than 12 months, taxed at regular personal income tax rates.&nbsp;Canada: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable, rising to two-thirds for gains exceeding CAD 2,50,000 from 24 June 2024.&nbsp;China: No tax on capital gains from shares listed on Chinese stock exchanges. However, a 20 per cent flat tax applies to other capital asset transfers, including securities and real estate.&nbsp;Germany: 25 per cent tax, plus a 5.5 per cent solidarity surcharge and 8-9 per cent church tax, depending on the federal state.&nbsp;United Arab Emirates: No capital gains tax.&nbsp;United Kingdom: Capital gains are taxed at rates of up to 20 per cent (excluding property), up to 24 per cent on residential property, and up to 28 per cent on carried interest gains. The UK also provides an annual tax-free exemption of GBP 3,000.&nbsp;United States: A progressive LTCG tax system, with rates of 0 per cent, 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, depending on taxable income and filing status.

The transport ministry, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), said on Wednesday that initially, this system would be applied on an exclusive lane on fee plazas for vehicles fitted with the GNSS system.GNSS works by using a network of satellites to determine precise locations on Earth. In the toll collection process, satellites are used to track a vehicle&#39;s movement and calculate tolls based on the distance. This move is expected to increase the efficiency of tolling operations by eliminating the need for waiting in queues at toll plazas.The highway lanes dedicated to GNSS-fitted vehicles will have advanced readers for identification.

The number of passive funds available to investors has grown from 149 in 2020 to 537 by December 2024, shows data analysed by Morningstar.&nbsp;&nbsp;As this investment trend continues to grow, selecting the right index fund has become an essential skill for investors aiming to tap into passive investing&rsquo;s full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;While passive funds can be an efficient way to invest, subtle differences in cost, tracking efficiency, and index methodology can dramatically affect the returns on these investments.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a simple checklist by&nbsp;&nbsp;Kongkon Gogoi, Senior Analyst, Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India to help you select an index fund that meets your needs:&nbsp;1. Focus on the Asset Class FirstThe first step in choosing an index fund is to decide on the asset class or sub-asset class that best aligns with your investment goals. Are you interested in broad exposure to large-cap or mid-cap equities, government bonds, or a specific theme like sustainability or technology? Alternatively, you might be looking for specialized exposures such as factor investing (e.g., low volatility, growth, momentum, or value stocks). Understanding your broader investment objectives is key before diving into specific index options.&nbsp;2. Consider InvestabilityInvestability refers to how easily the securities within an index can be traded. Indexes that track illiquid securities can lead to higher transaction costs and performance drag. For example, while AAA-rated bonds issued by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and state development loans (SDLs) are relatively liquid, they are not as frequently traded as government bonds, which could create liquidity issues in certain market conditions.&nbsp;When evaluating an index, check whether there are investable products (ETFs or mutual funds) tracking the index. The presence of such products indicates that the index is practical for portfolio implementation and has sufficient liquidity.&nbsp;3. Diversification and RepresentativenessA key benefit of passive investing is diversification, which minimizes risks associated with individual securities. When selecting an index fund, ensure that the index you are investing in adequately represents the asset class or market segment. A highly concentrated index may introduce risks that undermine the benefits of diversification. While specialized or narrow indexes may seem appealing, they are typically better suited for tactical allocations rather than long-term, passive investing.&nbsp;4. Evaluate Index Construction MethodologyThe construction methodology of an index should be sound and based on an economic rationale. Indices like the Nasdaq-100 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, may have peculiar selection criteria that don&#39;t necessarily align with sound investment logic. An index that uses arbitrary rules or subjective decisions (such as the S&P 500, which relies on an investment committee) may not provide the transparency needed for long-term investing.&nbsp;Make sure the methodology of the index you are considering is transparent and based on objective criteria. This allows you to better predict the index&rsquo;s performance across market environments.&nbsp;5. Low TurnoverTurnover refers to the frequency with which the securities in an index are bought and sold. High turnover can lead to increased trading costs, especially in illiquid markets, which can diminish returns. A well-constructed index will seek to minimize unnecessary turnover. Look for funds that implement buffers for market-cap changes to limit turnover and reduce associated costs.&nbsp;6. Minimize Tracking ErrorEven the best-constructed index is only as good as its ability to track its underlying benchmark. Tracking error measures how closely an index fund&rsquo;s performance matches that of its index. A low tracking error indicates that the fund is replicating the index accurately and efficiently. Investors should prioritize funds with a stable and low tracking error to ensure their returns closely align with the performance of the underlying index.&nbsp;7. Role of Market MakersWhen it comes to ETFs, the role of market makers cannot be overlooked. Market makers ensure liquidity and fair pricing by continuously providing buy and sell quotes. ETFs with strong and multiple market makers tend to have narrower bid-ask spreads and more efficient pricing. In contrast, funds with fewer market makers may suffer from poor liquidity, especially during market volatility.&nbsp;In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has mandated that each ETF should have at least two market makers to enhance liquidity and pricing efficiency. Before investing, ask your ETF provider who the market makers are and how many are involved in facilitating smooth trading.&nbsp;The difference between a well-constructed, efficient fund and one that fails to deliver often comes down to the details: Is the index well-structured, investable, and sufficiently diversified? These elements directly impact performance and risk, separating funds that merely exist from those that truly deliver. And don&#39;t overlook the unsung heroes&mdash;market makers&mdash;who keep ETFs liquid and prices fair.&nbsp;A good index fund is more than just low fees. Focus on your due diligence and dig deeper before deciding. And when it comes to highly specialized thematic or narrowly focused indexes, be extra cautious&mdash;they may look compelling, but they don&rsquo;t always deliver the diversification and stability that passive investors rely on.&nbsp; Here are the key takeaways:&nbsp;Choosing the Right Asset Class Matters:&nbsp;Investors should first determine the appropriate asset class or sub-asset class before selecting a benchmark. Passive investing is most effective in efficient markets with broad coverage and high liquidity.&nbsp;Assessing investability:&nbsp;Some indices include illiquid securities, making them difficult to track and costly to replicate Even in relatively high-quality fixed-income indexes like CRISIL IBX 70:30 CPSE Plus SDL April 2025 Index, nuances in market depth can present challenges.&nbsp;Index construction and its pitfalls&nbsp;Not all index methodologies are well-grounded in economic rationale.The Nasdaq-100 Index restricts inclusion to companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, an arbitrary constraint that excludes several major firms and not much representative of the US equity marketThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), despite its prominence, is flawed due to subjective stock selection and outdated price-weighted methodology rather than market capitalization weighting. This results in an index that does not accurately reflect market opportunities.&nbsp;Diversification & representativenessA well-structured index should mirror the underlying market composition.Highly concentrated indices introduce idiosyncratic risks, reducing the diversification advantage of passive investing.&nbsp;Market makers:&nbsp; The overlooked backbone of ETF liquidity&nbsp;&nbsp;Market makers are critical to ETF efficiency, ensuring fair pricing, tight bid-ask spreads, and smooth trade execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak market-making support can lead to liquidity issues, price dislocations, and higher trading costs, negating the benefits of passive investing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors tend overlook this factor, but market depth and competition among market makers directly impact an ETF&rsquo;s tradability and cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Key question to ask: Who is providing liquidity for this ETF, and how effectively are they maintaining pricing stability?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking error & fund efficiency&nbsp;The ultimate goal of an index fund is to closely replicate its benchmark.&nbsp;Investors should prioritize funds with low tracking errors to ensure minimal deviation from index returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["passive investing", "Index funds", "large cap funds", "Actively managed funds", "ELSS fundsETF", "Passive funds", "mutual funds", "AUMs", "wealth management"], "date": "2025-03-07T09:08:28+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030700126", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:29"},

Investors reacted negatively, leading to one of the worst trading days in months.&nbsp;The S&P 500 dropped 155.64 points, a 2.7 per cent decline, closing at 5,614.56&mdash;its lowest level since September and its steepest single-day percentage drop since December. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology stocks, plunged 727.90 points (4 per cent) to close at 17,468.32, its lowest since September.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 890.01 points (2.08 per cent) to 41,911.71, marking its weakest close since early November.&nbsp;Over the weekend, Trump was asked in an interview with Fox News Channel whether he foresaw a recession in 2025. His response, while not a direct confirmation, hinted at economic turbulence ahead.&nbsp;&ldquo;I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we&rsquo;re doing is very big. We&rsquo;re bringing wealth back to America. That&rsquo;s a big thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It takes a little time. It takes a little time.&rdquo;&nbsp;Investors fear that escalating trade tensions could push the US economy into a recession. While market corrections are not uncommon, steep declines like this have historically had multiple causes. Here&rsquo;s a look at past financial crises that shook markets worldwide.&nbsp;Major market crashes in the US&nbsp;The Great Depression (1929)Triggered by the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Great Depression severely impacted the global economy. The DJIA plunged nearly 25 per cent over two days (October 28-29). By mid-1932, the market had declined 89 per cent from its peak. The crash was fuelled by rampant speculation, excessive borrowing, and economic instability, leading to mass unemployment, food shortages, and widespread poverty.&nbsp;Black Monday (October 19, 1987)One of the most dramatic market crashes in history, Black Monday saw the DJIA plunge 22.6 per cent in a single day&mdash;the largest one-day percentage drop ever. Months of rapid stock gains had led to fears of an asset bubble, while a growing trade deficit and a weakening dollar further rattled investor confidence.&nbsp;Dot-com bubble burst (March 2000 - October 2002)The dot-com bubble burst after a period of rapid growth in IT and telecommunications. The rise of the internet led to an explosion of online businesses, attracting heavy investment. However, after peaking in March 2000, the Nasdaq crashed by about 78 per cent by October 2002 due to excessive speculation and failing tech startups.&nbsp;Post-9/11 market reaction (September 2001)Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, US stock markets remained closed for nearly a week. The destruction of the World Trade Center, a key financial hub, caused nearly 3,000 deaths and sent shockwaves through the economy.&nbsp;The airline and insurance industries were hit the hardest. With flights grounded for days, airline stocks saw steep losses. American Airlines and United Airlines, which operated the hijacked flights, suffered massive declines. The insurance industry also faced billions in claims, leading to a liquidity crisis for several firms.&nbsp;Global financial crisis (October 2008)The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a worldwide financial crisis. The Nasdaq, along with other major indices, experienced multiple days of declines exceeding 10 per cent. The crisis was driven by the collapse of major financial institutions, largely due to risky subprime mortgages and frozen credit markets. Banks, including those in the US and Northern Rock in the UK, had adopted a model where they originated and sold mortgages, packaging them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). In 2007, Northern Rock faced a run on deposits, which ended only when the UK government guaranteed them. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, plunging the global financial system into crisis. Government bailouts and stimulus measures were required to stabilise the financial system.&nbsp;Covid-19 market crash (March 2020)The Covid-19 pandemic caused extreme market volatility, with repeated 10 per cent+ drops in March 2020. Lockdowns, economic uncertainty, and investor panic led to trading halts.&nbsp;Major global market crashes&nbsp;2015 Chinese stock market crashBetween June 2014 and June 2015, China&rsquo;s Shanghai Composite Index surged 150 per cent, fuelled by speculative trading. By mid-2015, the bubble burst, causing a 32 per cent drop in a month and an overall 40 per cent decline.&nbsp;2022 Russian stock market crashFollowing Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) index fell 43.58 per cent in just four trading days in February 2022. Western sanctions and economic uncertainty fuelled panic selling, prompting Russia&rsquo;s central bank to halt trading temporarily.&nbsp;Major stock market crashes in India&nbsp;1865 cotton boom and bustOne of India&rsquo;s earliest market crashes was in May 1865, a decade before the Bombay Stock Exchange was incorporated. It was caused by excessive speculation in cotton exports during the American Civil War. When the war ended, cotton prices collapsed, triggering a severe market crash. Mumbai&rsquo;s economy suffered, and its population declined by 21 per cent over the next few years.&nbsp;1982 Reliance short-selling crisisA bear cartel attempted to crash Reliance Industries&rsquo; stock by offloading shares, driving prices down. In a few days, Reliance&rsquo;s share price dropped sharply. However, a counter-group known as the &ldquo;Friends of Reliance&rdquo; bought up shares, reversing the trend and stabilising the market.&nbsp;1992 Harshad Mehta scamStockbroker Harshad Mehta manipulated stock prices using fraudulent bank funds, inflating the BSE Sensex from 1,000 to over 4,500 points. When the scam was exposed, the market crashed by nearly 2,000 points, wiping out \u20b91 trillion in investor wealth.&nbsp;2008 global financial crisis impact on IndiaThe 2008 crisis led to foreign investors pulling out of Indian markets. The Sensex lost over 50 per cent of its value that year, with banks and financial stocks taking the worst hit.&nbsp;November 2016 demonetisationThe Indian government declared \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 notes would no longer be legal tender, causing a market shock. The BSE Sensex crashed nearly 1,689 points, while the NIFTY 50 fell 541 points.&nbsp;March 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crashThe Covid-19 outbreak led to panic selling across global markets, including India.

Over 30 police personnel were injured, with shops and vehicles gutted, leading to a curfew in several areas. Similar clashes occurred in June 2023 in Maharashtra&rsquo;s Kolhapur after social media posts allegedly glorified the Mughal ruler.&nbsp;Aurangzeb, the 17th-century Mughal emperor, remains a polarising figure. His over 50-year reign saw significant economic growth for India, but he is often remembered as a ruthless tyrant who allegedly hated music and ordered the destruction of several Hindu temples. While popular narratives describe his policies as intolerant towards non-Islamic faiths, some historians argue they were more politically motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s &lsquo;reign of terror&rsquo;&nbsp;Born Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad on November 3, 1618, in Dahod, Gujarat, Aurangzeb was the third son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. He ascended to the Mughal throne in 1658 after a power struggle, which included defeating his brother Dara Shikoh and imprisoning his father until the latter&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;Unlike his great-grandfather Akbar, known for his secular policies, Aurangzeb was less tolerant towards non-Muslims. He re-imposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims, which had been abolished by Akbar. Aurangzeb also ordered the destruction of some Hindu temples. The most noted act of his tyranny was the execution of the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, for refusing to convert to Islam. The Zafarnama, a letter written in 1705 by the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, indicts Aurangzeb for moral and spiritual bankruptcy, highlighting Guru Tegh Bahadur&rsquo;s sacrifice to save Hindus from forced conversion.&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s achievements&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s nearly 50-year reign from 1658 to 1707 marked the Mughal empire&rsquo;s greatest territorial extent, with significant military campaigns in South India. He successfully conquered the Deccan states, including Bijapur in 1686 and Golconda in 1687, extending the empire to cover about 4 million square kilometers by 1689, with a population over 158 million. His campaigns also reached southern regions like Tanjore and Trichinopoly, though maintaining control was challenging.&nbsp;Historian Angus Maddison estimates that in 1700, India accounted for approximately 25 per cent of the global GDP, surpassing the combined GDP of Europe at that time. This period also marked a phase of proto-industrialization, with India producing about 25 per cent of the world&rsquo;s industrial output up until the 18th century, excelling in sectors such as textiles, shipbuilding, and steel.&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s personal life included copying the Quran and sewing caps for a living, reflecting his piety, which contrasts with the ruthless ruler image often portrayed.&nbsp;Divide among historians&nbsp;While the destruction of temples under Aurangzeb&rsquo;s rule is highlighted, some historians note that he made exceptions in granting land and support to places of worship of Hindus and other faiths. In &lsquo;Aurangzeb: The Man and the Myth,&rsquo; historian Audrey Truschke notes the grant given by Aurangzeb to Jangam, a Shaivite group. Truschke also claims that there was a higher proportion of Hindus in Aurangzeb&rsquo;s administration compared to Akbar, arguing that his actions were often politically driven, not solely religious.&nbsp; In &#39;Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (Volumet 2),&#39; historian Satish Chandra notes that the Mughal ruler commissioned grants to some of the &quot;Vaishnava temples at Vrindavan, to the jogis at Jakhbar in Punjab, to the Nath Panthi jogis in Sarkar Nagaur, and grant of 100 pakka bighas of land to Panth Bharati in pargana Siwana in Rajasthan.&quot; He also gave grants to the gurdwara of Guru Ram Das in Dehradun, Chandra states.&nbsp;However, historian John F Richards opines that Aurangzeb&rsquo;s ultimate aim was the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam. In his book &lsquo;The Mughal Empire,&rsquo; part of The New Cambridge History of India series, Richards states, &ldquo;Whenever possible the emperor gave out robes of honour, cash gifts, and promotions to converts. It quickly became known that conversion was a sure way to the emperor&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;&nbsp;Contested legacy&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s legacy remains deeply contested, with interpretations of his rule varying between tyranny and pragmatism. While his policies contributed to the Mughal Empire&rsquo;s territorial expansion and economic strength, his religious intolerance and political ruthlessness left lasting scars.

The Bill seeks to update the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948, bringing clarity to resource governance, attracting private investment, and addressing environmental concerns.&nbsp;Key changes introduced in the bill&nbsp;The scope of mineral oils have been broadened by the amendment to include hydrocarbons such as crude oil, natural gas, petroleum, condensate, coal bed methane, shale gas, and oil. However, it explicitly excludes coal, lignite, and helium, likely because these are governed under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.&nbsp;The Bill replaces the term &lsquo;mining leases&rsquo; with &lsquo;petroleum leases&rsquo;, which will now govern exploration, production, and disposal activities. This change aims to streamline environmental and land clearances, which have often caused delays in oil and gas projects. The Bill clarifies that existing mining leases issued under the 1948 Act will remain valid and unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;The violations of the Oilfields Act, 1948, could previously result in imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of \u20b91,000, or both. The new Bill replaces imprisonment with financial penalties, increasing the maximum fine to \u20b925 lakh. If violations continue, an extra fine of up to \u20b910 lakh per day may be imposed. The move shifts the focus from criminal prosecution to financial deterrents for non-compliance.&nbsp;What are the objectives of the bill?&nbsp;The government aims to use this Bill to strengthen domestic oil and gas production, reducing dependence on imports. Currently, India imports over 85 per cent of its crude oil and about 50 per cent of its natural gas, making energy security a critical issue. Further, the Bill seeks to attract private investment into petroleum production while ensuring that the rights of existing leaseholders are not compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater central government control&nbsp;The Bill grants the Central government greater rule-making powers to regulate various aspects of petroleum leases, which included the merging of petroleum leases for operational efficiency, the sharing of infrastructure facilities among leaseholders, and the obligations of lessees to protect the environment and reduce emissions. It also introduces alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, allowing conflicts to be settled either within India or internationally.&nbsp;A new system for handling penalties has been introduced, with an officer of Joint Secretary rank or higher being appointed to adjudicate financial violations. Appeals against their decisions will be directed to the Appellate Tribunal under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) Act, 2006. If further appeals are needed, cases will be heard by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which operates under the Electricity Act, 2003.&nbsp;Potential concerns of the oil regulation bill&nbsp;One of the major concerns is whether the shift from mining leases to petroleum leases could affect states&rsquo; taxation powers under Entry 50 of the State List in the Indian Constitution.&nbsp;The Supreme Court ruling in Mineral Area Development Authority vs Steel Authority of India (2024) reaffirmed that states have exclusive power to tax mining activities. Critics argue that the Bill could lead to disputes over revenue-sharing and jurisdiction between states and the Centre since &lsquo;Entry 53 of the Union List&rsquo; gives the central government control over oilfields.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Bill promoting greater private sector involvement, some critics argue that it may weaken environmental safeguards. The new financial penalties replace imprisonment, which could reduce accountability for environmental violations and safety lapses in oilfields.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Opposition parties have raised concerns that government-owned enterprises like ONGC should be prioritised over private companies for oil exploration and production. There are fears that increased private participation could prioritise profit-making over community welfare and long-term sustainability.&nbsp;What are the Centre&rsquo;s plans?&nbsp;Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri defended the Bill, stating that it is a &lsquo;constructive and positive step&rsquo; toward boosting India&rsquo;s oil and gas production. He highlighted the government&rsquo;s commitment to opening up new exploration areas, including those previously classified as &lsquo;no-go zones&rsquo;.&nbsp;Additionally, the Bill aligns with the government&rsquo;s energy security strategy, particularly after the launch of the 10th Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bidding round on February 11, 2025. The primary focus of the policy is primarily offshore exploration blocks.&nbsp;Puri also noted that India&rsquo;s crude oil demand is expected to rise to 6.5-7 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 5.5 million bpd, emphasising the urgency of strengthening domestic production.", "keywords": ["Oilfields bill", "Oilfields bill upsc", "Oilfields amendment bill", "what is the Oilfields amendment bill", "Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri", "Hardeep Puri", "Lok Sabha", "Oilfield amendment", "Indian oilfields", "private investment in Indian oilfields"], "date": "2025-03-14T07:30:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125031400022", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:30"},

We have decided together to remove such themes from the film,&quot; he added.&nbsp;What is the controversy over Empuraan?&nbsp;Empuraan, second part of the &#39;Lucifer&#39; franchise, has become a topic of hot debate over its critique of right-wing politics and the covert mention of the 2002 Gujarat riots.&nbsp;The film&#39;s content was vehemently criticised by right-wing social media handles, with some demanding that the honorary Lieutenant Colonel rank of Mohanlal in the territorial army be revoked.&nbsp;An article published in Organiser, an RSS-linked magazine, called the film a medium of spreading an &quot;anti-Hindu and anti-BJP narrative&quot; that threatens to further divide &quot;an already fractured&quot; India. The film delved into the &quot;sensitive subject&quot; of the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat with a &quot;clear and alarming bias&quot;, it alleged.&nbsp;Political controversy&nbsp;The criticism soon took a political turn with the Congress and Left parties accusing the BJP of showing intolerance towards the movie. Newly appointed BJP state president Rajeev Chandrasekhar said he won&#39;t watch Mohanlal-starrer film, adding that any movie that tries to build a story by distorting the truth is doomed to fail.&nbsp;Senior BJP leader and Union Minister of State for Minority Affairs George Kurian said he is yet to watch the movie but would surely see it. He said senior party leader MT Ramesh had already made it clear that a cinema should be seen as a cinema. &quot;I will surely watch the movie. What is wrong in watching a movie?&quot; he asked.&nbsp;Actor-turned Union Minister Suresh Gopi was also reluctant to give any direct reply over the &#39;Empuraan&#39; controversy. When the media repeatedly asked about the movie, a visibly annoyed Gopi said &quot;speak good things&quot;.&nbsp;AICC general secretary KC Venugopal alleged that the BJP&#39;s criticism of the movie was part of the intolerance of Sangh Parivar.&nbsp;Pointing out the recently released movies like &#39;The Accidental Prime Minister&#39; and &#39;Emergency,&#39; Venugopal said such films were critical of the Congress, but the BJP welcomed all of them.&nbsp;Empuraan to undergo 17 cuts&nbsp;Following the controversy, &#39;Empuraan&#39; is set to undergo 17 changes, including edits to riot sequences and scenes relating violence against women, according to the film&#39;s production team.&nbsp;However, this was opposed by the ruling CPI(M).

The Bill has sparked protests from Muslim organisations, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).&nbsp;Background and Opposition concerns &nbsp;&nbsp;Initially introduced in August 2023 amid strong opposition, the Bill was subsequently referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) led by BJP MP Jagadambika Pal. After months of deliberation, the committee submitted its report on February 13 this year, which the Union Cabinet approved on February 19. However, opposition MPs on the panel have raised concerns that their proposed amendments were rejected and their dissent notes were omitted without their knowledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;The JPC accepted 14 changes suggested by NDA members while rejecting all 44 amendments proposed by opposition MPs.&nbsp;The panel&#39;s deliberations were also marked by disruptions. TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee was suspended for a day after allegedly disrupting proceedings and smashing a bottle on the table.&nbsp;Additionally, six opposition MPs &mdash; including Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), Mohammad Jawed (Congress), Sanjay Singh (AAP), Mohammed Nadimul Haque (TMC), and MM Abdulla (DMK) &mdash; wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, accusing Pal of &ldquo;bulldozing the proceedings.&quot;&nbsp;In their letter, the opposition members said, &ldquo;We, the members from the Opposition, feel that the constitution of the panel, i.e., a mini Parliament, should not be treated as a mere ventilating chamber to get the Bill passed as desired by the government, ignoring the parliamentary process by using the so-called &lsquo;majority&rsquo; undemocratically. Hence, it is our duty to bring to your notice with pain that bulldozing the proceedings of the parliamentary committee without assigning reasonable and plausible time pause as against the will of the members is nothing but an act of atrocious onslaught on the Constitutional religion and Parliament.&quot;&nbsp; Read: Waqf Amendment Bill LIVE&nbsp;What is Waqf? &nbsp;&nbsp;Waqf refers to a charitable or religious endowment in the form of property, primarily within the Muslim community. These properties are often donated without formal documentation, and their proceeds are used to maintain mosques, graveyards, madrasas, and orphanages. &nbsp;&nbsp;Key provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;The government asserts that the proposed amendments aim to enhance the administration and management of waqf properties. According to an official statement issued in September 2023, the Bill seeks to &quot;overcome the shortcomings of the previous Act and enhance the efficiency of Waqf boards by introducing changes such as renaming the Act, updating the definition of Waqf, improving the registration process, and increasing the role of technology in managing Waqf records.&quot;&nbsp;However, opposition parties and Muslim organisations have strongly opposed the Bill, calling it &quot;unconstitutional&quot; and detrimental to the interests of the Muslim community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Controversial provisions&nbsp;Among the many proposed changes, five provisions have drawn significant criticism from Muslim organisations, including the AIMPLB: &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Changes to waqf council and state boards&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Bill mandates the inclusion of non-Muslims in the central waqf council and state waqf boards, a move seen as an encroachment on Muslim affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Dispute resolution by government officials &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In cases of dispute, a senior state government official will have the final say on whether a property belongs to waqf or the government. This replaces the existing system where such decisions are made by waqf tribunals.&nbsp;3. Restructuring of waqf tribunals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Bill proposes changes to the waqf tribunal&rsquo;s composition, which will include a district judge and a state government official of joint secretary rank. Additionally, tribunal decisions can be challenged in the high court. &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Mandatory property registration &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Every waqf property must be registered on a central portal within six months of the law taking effect. However, the waqf tribunal may extend this timeline in specific cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;5. Removal of &#39;waqf by user&#39; clause &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This clause, which allowed properties to be recognised as waqf if used for religious or charitable purposes over time without formal documentation, has been scrapped. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Following an intervention by NDA ally TDP, the JPC has recommended that this change should not be applied retrospectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;Waqf row: Political fallout &nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has ignited a heated political debate, with the Opposition accusing the government of targetting Muslim religious institutions. AIMIM MP Owaisi has been at the forefront of the criticism, calling the Bill a direct attack on religious freedoms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This Bill is unconstitutional. If no non-Hindu can become a member of the Hindu Endowment Board, then why are you making a non-Muslim here?&quot; Owaisi questioned, referring to the proposed restructuring of the waqf council. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, Union Minister of Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju has dismissed these allegations, accusing the Opposition of misleading the Muslim community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Some people are saying that the Bill is unconstitutional. Waqf rules, its provisions have been in existence since before Independence... then how can it be illegal?&quot; Rijiju said, denying claims that the Bill seeks to seize waqf properties.", "keywords": ["Waqf Amendment Bill 2024", "Waqf Bill", "Waqf Bill row", "Waqf Bill protests", "what is Waqf Bill", "Waqf Bill explained", "Waqf Bill controversy", "Waqf Bill timeline", "Waqf Bill owaisi", "Waqf Bill proposals", "Waqf Bill provisions", "Waqf Bill controversial provisions", "Waqf Bill meaning", "Centre introduces Waqf Bill", "Waqf property", "Waqf law changes", "Parliament Waqf Bill", "Waqf protests", "Opposition on Waqf Bill", "Waqf Tribunal", "Waqf Council", "Waqf board explained", "Waqf Bill news", "Waqf Bill latest", "Waqf Bill all you need to know", "Waqf Bill all details", "Waqf Bill amendment bill"], "date": "2025-04-02T09:27:54+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040200206", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:35"},

The roundtable, organised in collaboration with the State Planning Commission and Guidance Tamil Nadu, was centered around the theme of &quot;Reimagining Tamil Nadu: Path to Knowledge Economy.&quot;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know that &lsquo;product nation&rsquo; is something that sounds very small, just two words. The depth of those two words, and I know that the industry understands that.

We are doing this for India; a healthy, flourishing, strong India is essential; it&#39;s extremely key for Tamil Nadu,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;He added that the manufacturing talent of Tamil Nadu is at par with Japan. &ldquo;Let&#39;s start re-engineering, let&#39;s start doing things on our own, let&#39;s start products for our own consumption, let&#39;s create from the bottom up our own products.

The panel, featuring distinguished experts, provided valuable insights on strengthening safety protocols, leveraging automation, and fostering a resilient workforce.&nbsp;Shivendra Parihar, joint director at the Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD), explored how human factors play a crucial role in improving HSE performance. As the key interface between the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and industry stakeholders, OISD is committed to setting and enforcing safety norms through structured audits, training initiatives, and regulatory frameworks. Parihar emphasised the need for leadership commitment, robust organisational structures, and clear performance indicators to drive a culture of proactive risk management.&nbsp;He also underscored the importance of effective communication in accident prevention, citing past industrial disasters where miscommunication led to catastrophic consequences. Clear, multilingual instructions, structured shift handovers, and open feedback channels are essential to maintaining workplace safety and operational excellence.&nbsp;Dr Sandeep Sharma, chief general manager (HSE-Medical) at IndianOil Corporation Ltd, introduced a pioneering approach to petroleum storage tank cleaning using robotic scavenging machines. This innovative solution eliminates human exposure to confined, hazardous spaces, significantly improving both safety and efficiency. These automated systems also facilitate the complete recovery of hydrocarbons from sludge, promoting environmental sustainability. Dr Sharma highlighted how automation in high-risk tasks not only reduces operational downtime but also aligns with global safety and environmental compliance standards, setting a new benchmark in the industry.&nbsp;Dr Deepashri Nage, deputy general manager at Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, addressed the pressing challenge of corrosion under insulation (CUI), which accounts for a significant percentage of industrial equipment failures. She explained that CUI can progress up to 20 times faster than atmospheric corrosion, leading to leaks, shutdowns, and even explosions. As a solution, she presented thermal insulating coatings (TICs), an in-house innovation designed to combat this issue. Unlike conventional insulation, TICs offer dual benefits: superior CUI protection and enhanced personnel safety, while also reducing maintenance costs and improving energy conservation. Advancements in materials science, she noted, are key to revolutionising infrastructure longevity and operational reliability.&nbsp;Dr Rama Srinivasan, chief general manager (HR) at GAIL (India) Ltd, highlighted the growing need for mental health support in high-risk industries. He stressed the direct correlation between demanding job roles and mental fatigue, advocating for structured support systems within energy companies. By incorporating psychological research and industry-specific case studies, he illustrated how chronic workplace stress can impair decision-making, increase safety risks, and diminish overall productivity.

He explored how emotional states impact physical health, citing links between anger and liver health, grief and lung function, and stress with cardiovascular strain. Ramesh advocated for neurobics, mental exercises incorporating mudras, colours, and mantras, to stimulate specific energy centres (chakras) and counteract workplace stress.

Julien Tornare says innovation is key", "content": "&ldquo;Luxury needs to keep pace with time &mdash; it can be rooted in heritage but must also innovate,&rdquo; said Julien Tornare, chief executive officer of Swiss luxury watch brand Hublot, while speaking at the second edition of Business Standard Manthan on Friday. With the discussion themed Can India Create Its Own LVMH? he said there was immense potential for the country to create world-renowned brands.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nobody comes to India to shop,&rdquo; he said. People come to India to experience its culture and heritage. &ldquo;A strong tourism ecosystem can also be used to help visitors experience India&rsquo;s brands.&rdquo;&nbsp;He said that like Swiss watches, known for their craftsmanship, India has a rich tradition of exquisite craftsmanship, whether in textiles or jewellery. &ldquo;The gap lies in turning this craftsmanship and heritage into luxury products that the world is familiar with.&rdquo;&nbsp;He gave the example of Hublot, which is barely 45 years old yet well-known. The Swiss watch industry, Tornare said, is perceived to be very conservative and leans on the past a lot.&nbsp;&ldquo;But even if you use techniques from decades ago, the brand has to communicate with a younger generation and must be innovative and creative in doing so,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Hublot, established in 1980, became a member of the global luxury conglomerate LVMH in April 2008. It opened its first boutique in India in 2019 in Mumbai and has now opened its second boutique in Bengaluru.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hublot is often referred to as the terrible kid of the watch industry. We continue to push the limits, which is key to our competitive advantage,&rdquo; Tornare said, adding, &ldquo;You have to take advantage of who you are but also be contemporary.&rdquo;&nbsp;Talking about how India can build its own globally recognised luxury brand, Tornare said, &ldquo;It is very important for a brand to not only talk about its heritage and story but also show that it will evolve with its clients and remain young.&rdquo;&nbsp;Successful brands thrive on authenticity.&nbsp;&ldquo;When people think of high-end shoes, they think of Italy. For fashion, it&rsquo;s France or Italy. For luxury watches, it&rsquo;s Switzerland. Heritage is a great advantage. These associations create credibility and desirability, but you have to evolve,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Speaking about the Indian luxury market, Tornare, on his first trip to the country, said it is an important market for the brand.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were among the first Swiss watch brands to enter India. Maybe 20 years ago, India didn&rsquo;t have the right environment for luxury brands, but things are developing faster, and the landscape is changing. We see more shopping malls offering the right environment for luxury brands. Entering a market early gives a brand a competitive advantage,&rdquo; said Tornare.&nbsp;&ldquo;New avenues of luxury shopping are still being developed. The country has huge potential for luxury shopping, which will be a way for Indian brands to showcase their expertise and craft,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Tornare also called upon the Indian diaspora to help grow Indian brands globally.&ldquo;Indians are travelling more than ever, and there are Indian communities all over the world. It is important for them to talk about homegrown luxury brands to help people abroad know more about them,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Citing South Korea as an example, he said the country has done a good job of exporting its culture in recent years &mdash; from Korean TV shows to K-pop to several brands, they have become ambassadors for the country.&nbsp;On high taxes on luxury goods in India, Tornare said it is a challenge they have managed in China as well.&nbsp;&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m going to build the brand in India for the long term, and we will continue to invest in India in the coming years. It is among the biggest potential markets for us,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Tornare also spoke about exploring partnerships with Indian chefs, textiles, and even sports.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is important to have a global strategy but also connect with local values.

He warned that once a quantum computer with the right speed emerges, it will pose a &quot;significant cybersecurity threat to every country.&quot;&nbsp;In India, startups have already developed products based on quantum technology that can be deployed in areas such as financial systems, defence and security, Chowdhry said at the event.&nbsp;&ldquo;If we implement quantum key distribution in the country early, we will be quantum secure.

Over time, the country will need to move from generic drugs to having the patent and ownership of its own molecules to move up the value chain in pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;Technologies such as quantum computing can be used in this space not just to speed up the process of discovery but also lower the cost of discovering new molecules, he said, adding that the time to discover these molecules could be cut down to a couple of years from the 15-year timeframe.&nbsp;&ldquo;A lot of the early users have started thinking ahead of the time and started working on quantum computers so that they can actually learn how to do it. They do not replace classical computers which will continue to be used for novel applications,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quantum computers, instead, will be used for specialised applications such as financial modelling, large applications in manufacturing and design in days to come.

Experts debate&nbsp;On April 19, 2023, the Union Cabinet approved the National Quantum Mission with a total outlay of \u20b96,003.65 crore till 2031. The aim of the mission is to seed, nurture and scale up scientific and industrial research and development, and an innovative ecosystem in quantum technology.&nbsp;Chowdhry, who is the chairman of the governing board of the NQM, said that of the total \u20b96,000 crore, roughly \u20b92,000 crore is being brought by the department of space, atomic energy and defense.&nbsp;The governing board has come out with a request for proposal seeking applications from researchers and institutions who need to get funds to work on quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum sensing and quantum materials, he said.&nbsp;Under the National Quantum Mission, the government also aims to develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1,000 physical qubits in 8 years in various platforms like superconducting and photonic technology.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are no longer talking about writing papers. We are now talking about making products. There are targets for making products in every part of the machine. We shortlisted four places where we will put up our hubs and 80 researchers will work on different parts of this (quantum) technology,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Apart from computing gains, the National Quantum Mission also aims to develop satellite-based secure quantum communications between ground stations over a range of 2,000 kilometers within India, long-distance secure quantum communications with other countries, inter-city quantum key distribution over 2,000 km as well as multi-node quantum networks with quantum memories are also some of the deliverables of the Mission.&nbsp;It will also focus on developing magnetometers with high sensitivity in atomic systems and atomic clocks for precision timing, communications, and navigation. The mission also aims to support the design and synthesis of quantum materials such as superconductors, novel semiconductor structures, and topological materials for the fabrication of quantum devices.&nbsp;&ldquo;In research, we talk about TRL (technology readiness level) 1 to TRL 9. TRL 9 is when the product goes to the market. So we are insisting with every researcher that they need to take the development of (the product) they are doing to a TRL 7 at least when they have a choice to start their own venture or hand it over to a startup to take it from there,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The eight-year target to develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1,000 physical qubits is no longer relevant, Chowdhry said, adding that these targets will need to be revised.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is something we are seriously discussing within the mission to say how we can improve on the targets originally planned. The world is changing and there is so much innovation going on in quantum today,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The development of new materials such as Microsoft&rsquo;s Majorana 1, a topoconductor, is a major challenge as they will be computing power at the right qubit level much faster than originally thought, Chowdhry said.&nbsp;The country also needs to think about the uptake of the semiconductor chips that are being made in India as most of these silicon chips will be for exports. To solve this issue, the government will also need to shift focus to designing in India. To encourage the uptake of India-made semiconductor manufacturing chips, all government purchases must be only for Indian chips.&nbsp;India, however, does not need to set up the most advanced units to make bleeding edge semiconductor chips as the country neither has the need nor the money needed to make such units functional, he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In making semiconductors, the RoI (return on investment) takes 10 years. So, you put up a plant like TSMC, it takes up to five years to come up, the investment will be huge and returns will not be there because TSMC will have gone up further,&rdquo; he added.", "keywords": ["BS manthan", "BS manthan summit", "Business standard annual summit", "India technology sovereignty", "strategic autonomy", "quantum technology India", "EPIC Foundation", "Ajai Chowdhry", "HCL co-founder", "emerging technologies India", "tech independence", "India innovation", "deep tech India", "national security technology", "quantum computing India", "indigenous technology development", "digital transformation India", "self-reliant India tech"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:13:36+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022800907", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:38"},

Experts debate", "content": "At the second edition of BS Manthan, Business Standard&rsquo;s annual thought leadership summit, industry leaders discussed the future of agriculture in India. While Ramesh Chand, member of NITI Aayog, contended that agriculture has been and will remain India&rsquo;s strength, CSC Sekhar, professor at Institute of Economic Growth (IEG) and Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman of Bharat Krishak Samaj, argued that there is an urgent need to address the issues of small and marginal farmers.&nbsp;In a panel discussion moderated by Business Standard&rsquo;s Sanjeeb Mukherjee, Ramesh Chand said that &ldquo;agriculture was, is and will remain India&rsquo;s strength&rdquo; due to its labour advantage. He credited country&rsquo;s farmers, especially those with small landholdings, for promptly responding to global signals and adopting modern technology.&nbsp;CSC Sekhar, who is also the honorary director (former), Agricultural Economics Research Centre at University of Delhi, said that though agriculture has been India&rsquo;s strength and continues to be so, the small and marginal farmers, who comprise 90 per cent of the sector, are battling low income issues. &ldquo;A lot needs to be done on policy and implementation angles,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Farm income variations&nbsp;According to Ajay Jakhar, around 650 million Indians are involved in the agriculture sector but 60-70 per cent of them earn less than Rs 10,000 a month. Jakhar, who is UN Food Champion at the UN Food Systems Summit, compared this to the income of government employees who, along with salary hikes in pay commissions, get additional benefits like medical cover and pension.&nbsp;&ldquo;At mid-level, a government employee&rsquo;s salary starts at Rs 35,000 and it may increase to Rs 1 lakh per month. And on the other hand, you have farmers who will have a salary of Rs 10,000 a month,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;On farm income, Chand argued that there is a big variation across the country. Citing Punjab&rsquo;s example, Chand said the income of a farmer is more than that of a non-farmer in the state. &ldquo;While there are problems with the agriculture sector there (Punjab), it is the model in terms that agriculture can be transformed in a way where the income of a farmer is higher than that of a non-farmer,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Is agriculture profitable?&nbsp;Chand cited the remarkable growth rate agriculture has achieved in the past decade. &ldquo;In the last 10 years, the growth rate of agriculture is the highest, which is around 4 per cent. There used to be a target of 4-5 per cent growth rate but it was never achieved before,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Jakhar, however, argued that agriculture is non-profitable, especially for small farmers. Either the government finds alternate employment opportuNITIes for farmers or supports them through healthcare, education costs and public transport, he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to focus on cash transfers (direct payment). It is not going to change the livelihood (of farmers),&rdquo; said Jakhar. To address this, Jakhar said India needs to have an agriculture policy, which has not been there for 30 years now.&nbsp;Sekhar concurred, saying that direct payment to farmers is no longer a good option. &ldquo;A few years ago, direct payments appeared to be a good option. But now with an increase in cost of cultivation, it has shot up substantially,&rdquo; Sekhar said, adding that a better option could be deficiency payment, which is the difference between the market price of a crop and a minimum support price.", "keywords": ["business standard manthan", "bs manthan", "agriculture in India", "small farmers India", "farm income", "NITI Aayog", "farm income in India", "Indian agriculture growth", "agricultural economy", "farmer income disparity", "rural economy India"], "date": "2025-02-28T19:23:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022801104", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:38"},

In a fireside chat themed &#39;The Great Reset: India in a New World Order&#39; at Business Standard&rsquo;s annual event BS Manthan on February 28, Bery emphasised the need for structural reforms to modernise agriculture and integrate more women into the workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bery described India as an &quot;agri tiger&quot; with untapped potential. &quot;We need to be unleashed, but we are stuck,&quot; he said, noting that while the existing agricultural model prevented food shortages, it now requires evolution. He called for placing horticulture and crop farming on equal footing to improve productivity and efficiency.&nbsp;On labour, Bery stressed the importance of formalisation. &quot;Formalisation of labour contracts and the workforce is important, and it&#39;s probably the labour laws that make medium and large scale enterprises shy of hiring labour,&quot; he said, referring to global studies on employment structures.&nbsp;Bery also highlighted the necessity of increasing women&#39;s participation in the labour force. &quot;Our most underutilised resource is women. The Prime Minister has focused on this from the beginning, and there has been progress in women labour force participation,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Maintaining the unity of India&rsquo;s labour market was another key concern. Bery highlighted the importance of ensuring seamless labour mobility across states, even for seasonal migration, to balance the country&rsquo;s diverse demographic trends.&nbsp;Global financial stability a must for growth&nbsp;Discussing global economic shifts, Bery acknowledged the impact of US policies on trade and tariffs. He noted that while India had traditionally adhered to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, recent developments had forced it to reassess its position. &quot;If what we want is 7 per cent growth, lower tariffs are one way of achieving that,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Bery also pointed out that investment conditions in India needed improvement. &quot;We need to enhance the investment climate for both domestic and foreign investors,&quot; he said, adding that trade agreements should be structured to maximise India&rsquo;s benefits.&nbsp;On climate and energy, Bery highlighted financing challenges in India&rsquo;s transition towards sustainable energy. &quot;The real issue is the fiscal challenge of financing adaptation while maintaining growth,&quot; he said. The Niti Aayog Vice Chairperson noted that state governments were increasingly taking independent initiatives in urban and labour reforms, requiring a coordinated approach at the national level.&nbsp;Bery also addressed the changing global power structure, particularly US-China-Russia relations. &ldquo;The US, at the time of Kissinger, thought that driving a wedge between Russia and China was important. Equally today, it is in India&rsquo;s interest that Russia be freed from the Chinese embrace. That is a possible consequence of the replacement of the Biden admin by Trump admin,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Addressing a query on how diverse and complex is this global reset, Bery invoked examples from history, with the establishment of the dominance of the US post second world war. &ldquo;The story begins with the US as the dominant power after the second world war. For whatever reason, they created a set of institutions (the UN, the World Bank, IMF etc). Let&rsquo;s be clear, anytime this did not suit them, they felt able to change. Example being Nixon going off the Bretton woods system,&quot; Bery said.&nbsp;&quot;Second was when Japan was dragged to the Plaza Accord. US treatment of the WTO. The notion that the US has the privilege to reshape the rules of the game to suit itself, is not unusual. What is intriguing is why the US feels beleaguered at this time. There is American exceptionalism in tech, market, growth and productivity,&rdquo; he remarked.", "keywords": ["BS Manthan", "business Standard Manthan event", "PM Modi", "Prime Minister Narendra Modi", "Niti aayog", "Suman Bery", "Suman Bery NITI Aayog", "Trump", "Trump tariffs", "India FTAs", "Climate change", "Donald trump"], "date": "2025-02-28T19:15:06+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022801086", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:38"},

The company posted a sequential revenue growth of 2.6 per cent Q-o-Q, recovering from a lacklustre Q1, which aligned with Emkay&rsquo;s estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ebitda margin dropped considerably by 260 basis points Q-o-Q to 12.1 per cent, falling short of the estimated 14.7 per cent. The decline, analysts noted, was due to planned investments in technology, domain capabilities, and partnerships, along with high initial costs related to consolidation deals involving onshore presence.&nbsp;Looking ahead, Emkay forecasts that margins will likely remain subdued in Q3 due to anticipated wage hikes, expected to impact margins by approximately 150 basis points, although improvement is expected by Q4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deal-win total contract value (TCV) saw a notable decline, down 19.3 per cent year-over-year on a trailing twelve-month basis, as client decision-making processes are still experiencing delays, analysts said. Nevertheless, TCV is projected to improve in the second half of the fiscal year, with some positive signs emerging, although more clarity is expected by the end of calendar year 2024. Revenue momentum is anticipated to continue despite seasonal weaknesses in H2FY25.&nbsp;Consequently, Emkay has revised its FY25-27 earnings per share (EPS) estimates down by 5-16 per cent to account for lower margins.

The profit also declined 8.31 per cent Q-o-Q from Rs 127.5 crore in Q2FY25.&nbsp;Revenue rose merely 1.5 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 1,326.7 crore in Q3FY25, from Rs 1,342.9 crore in Q3FY24. However, revenue dropped 0.4 per cent sequentially from Rs 1,368.2 crore in Q2FY25.&nbsp;At the operating level, earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) plummeted 26.4 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 142.2 crore in Q3FY25, from Rs 193.2 crore in Q3FY24. Ebit margin squeezed 400bps to 10.4 per cent in Q3FY25, compared to 14.4 per cent in Q3FY24.&nbsp;Meanwhile, here&rsquo;s what top brokerages said about Birlasoft post Q3:&nbsp;Nomura&nbsp;Analysts at Nomura have cut their FY26-27F EPS by 3.2-3.4 per cent, primarily driven by lower revenue growth estimates. Their FY26-27F EPS estimates are ~11-12 per cent lower than Bloomberg consensus.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, they have lowered the target price to Rs 560, from Rs 590 previously, based on an unchanged multiple of 22x FY27F EPS. However, the brokerage has maintained its &lsquo;Neutral&rsquo; rating.&nbsp;Analysts believe the company needs to improve the predictability of its revenue growth profile for a re-rating to take place. Key upside risks, analysts believe, include higher-than-expected revenue growth and margin improvement. Key downside risks, they said, include a prolonged period of low growth and delay in margin recovery.&nbsp;Emkay&nbsp;Emkay analysts noted that Birlasoft&rsquo;s Q3 performance was a mixed bag, with revenue missing expectations and margin beating estimates. Revenue fell due to higher-than-usual furloughs (a 150bps hit). Despite salary hikes and planned investments, the Ebit margin decline was curbed to 10bps Q-o-Q, backed by operational efficiency and rupee depreciation. Management guided for a soft Q4 due to extended furloughs in healthcare (till January) and ramp-downs of a few projects.&nbsp;The management believes margins have bottomed out and should recover, but the pace of improvement depends on revenue acceleration. Deal intake stood at $226 million in Q3, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x &mdash; the strongest as of FY25TD. Management observed signs of a pickup in BFSI and emerging green shoots in discretionary spending, but remains cautiously optimistic about the growth uptick.&nbsp;Thus, Emkay cut FY25-27E EPS by 0.9-5.5 per cent, incorporating the Q3 results. It also trimmed the target multiple to 22x (from 25x), maintaining an &lsquo;Add&rsquo; rating with a revised target price of Rs 570 (down 15 per cent) due to undemanding valuations.&nbsp;Nuvama&nbsp;Nuvama noted that Birlasoft&rsquo;s revenue was lower than the estimate, while Ebit margin was ahead of the estimate. New deal TCV was soft at $226 million (+4 per cent Y-o-Y), with net new at $64 million (-32 per cent Y-o-Y).&nbsp;Analysts said Birlasoft continued to disappoint on growth and deal wins, with revenue expected to decline further in Q4 due to extended furloughs and client ramp-downs. The weak exit rate, along with soft TCV, paints a dismal picture for FY26.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, analysts have sharply cut FY25E/26E EPS by -5 per cent and -10 per cent, respectively, on lower growth and margin expectations. They have also reduced the target valuation to 18x (from 20x) as they roll forward to Mar-27. They maintained a &lsquo;Reduce&rsquo; rating with a target price of Rs 465 (down from Rs 540).&nbsp;HDFC Securities&nbsp;Those at HDFC Securities noted that Birlasoft reported lower-than-estimated revenue with stable margins in Q3. The revenue was impacted by higher-than-usual furloughs and project ramp-downs in the manufacturing and life-sciences verticals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The company indicated extended furloughs in Q4, resulting in a weak exit growth rate for FY25E. The demand environment remains uncertain, with clients taking a &lsquo;hold and wait&rsquo; approach to IT spending.&nbsp;However, there are green shoots in the BFSI vertical (24 per cent of the revenue). Growth will be led by BFSI and E&U, while manufacturing and life-sciences will continue to struggle for a couple of quarters.&nbsp;Given these factors, analysts have lowered EPS estimates, primarily due to weak Q4 and a protracted rate of recovery. However, they maintained an &lsquo;Add&rsquo; rating on Birlasoft with a revised target price of Rs 510 (down from Rs 620).", "keywords": ["Buzzing Stock", "Birlasoft share price today", "Birlasoft", "Birlasoft Q3 results", "Birlasoft earnings", "Birlasoft deal wins", "Birlasoft Ebit", "Birlasoft stock price today", "Birlasoft share price", "Birlasoft Shares", "Birlasoft Stock Price", "Birlasoft stocks", "Birlasoft share levels", "Birlasoft share new updates"], "date": "2025-02-12T10:24:35+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021200406", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:52"},

The BSE Pharma index plunged over 3 per cent after the US President Donald Trump announced his plan for reciprocal tariffs as early as April onwards.&nbsp; The US President signed a memo, ordering his economic team to devise plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing US imports, ramping up the prospects for a global trade war.&nbsp; Speaking to the reporters, Donald Trump said &quot;India has more tariffs than nearly any other country.&quot; He would enact import taxes on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals &quot;over and above&quot; the reciprocal tariffs at a later date, Trump added.&nbsp; That apart, Trump reiterated his threat of up to 100 per cent tariffs on BRICs nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China - if they pursue plans to shift away from the US dollar.&nbsp; Broader indices crack&nbsp; The broader indices witnessed deeper cuts, with the BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices down 2.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively.&nbsp; The broader markets are witnessing intense selling pressure given the high-beta nature, wherein stocks react sharply to major news developments.

Taiwan follows, with FPIs selling $2.5 billion worth of shares in 2025.&nbsp; Technical view on Nifty&nbsp; The NSE Nifty is seen trading at its lowest point in nearly 10 months. The index is seen quoting below the key moving averages on the daily scale. Further, the weekly chart shows that the 20-WMA (Weekly Moving Average) at 23,970 is now seen on course to slip below the 50-WMA at 23,778. Technically, this trading pattern shall further weigh on the investor sentiment.&nbsp; The Nifty is now within striking distance of the key long-term support at 22,450 levels - which is the 20-MMA (Monthly Moving Average). A key indicator the index has held since August 2020. Break and trade below the same can accentuate the fall towards 21,500 levels.&nbsp; The overall bias for the Nifty is likely to remain tepid as long as the index sustains below 24,050 levels. Near hurdles for the index are placed at 23,250, 23,600 and 23,800 levels.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["nifty fall", "stock market fall", "stock market correciton", "market crash", "nifty downtrend", "bear market", "market trends", "sensex", "BSE", "NSE", "BSE market capitalisation", "trump tariffs", "reciporcal tariffs", "trump modi meeting", "stock market crash today", "sensex today down", "sensex live", "nifty live", "Sensex fall", "why is market down today", "nifty sensex today", ""], "date": "2025-02-14T15:26:41+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021400891", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:41:56"},

CLICK HERE FOR REPORT&nbsp;Interestingly, Trump&rsquo;s first term coincided with a challenging period for Indian pharma, resulting in subdued stock performance over five years. During this time, the sector not only underperformed the Nifty 50 index until December 2020 but also posted negative returns until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sector struggled with various factors, including consolidation in the US distribution channels, regulatory challenges from the FDA concerning key plants, a lack of major product approvals, as well as price control measures and a ban on FDCs in India, according to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities.&nbsp;While none of these issues were directly caused by Trump&#39;s presidency, his ongoing focus on US manufacturing, tariff increases, and efforts to reduce drug costs raised concerns within the pharmaceutical industry. It is likely that, apart from the emphasis on domestic drug manufacturing, most of Trump&rsquo;s policies will be beneficial to Indian generic pharma companies, the brokerage firm said in the January 2025 sector report.&nbsp;&ldquo;In our view, most of the expected changes to the US healthcare system under Trump 2.0 are likely to benefit Indian players, except for the push for increased US drug production. Expanding US drug manufacturing on a large scale is a counter-intuitive move, as it would likely lead to higher drug prices, undermining the primary goal of reducing healthcare costs,&rdquo; analysts said.&nbsp;While price negotiations for novel products may drive more outsourcing to CDMOs, the removal of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) or the introduction of more wholesaler groups to reduce the bargaining power of intermediaries would benefit Indian generic players. Additionally, the imposition of high tariffs on China, along with efforts to reduce dependence on China for medicines and medical research, would benefit Indian manufacturers.

Edited excerpts:&nbsp;The net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) growth was modest. How much has the deposit cost played an impact?&nbsp;If you look at the interest expenses, it is growing faster than the increase in the interest income. Currently, the deposit market is very tight, both in terms of growth and also on the cost side. So, clearly, the cost of deposit is higher resulting in a lower NII growth. Our nine months&rsquo; margin has been 3.08 per cent and for the full year, we are targeting a NIM of something between 3 to 3.10 i.e., 3.05 +/- 5 basis points (bps), with an upward bias. There is an expectation of a rate cut, and if that happens a lot of the borrowing market and the certificate of deposits (CD) market would react to that. And that typically brings down the cost on the resources side. Hence, on the NIM side, we are quite hopeful that the full year, the margin we can keep it somewhere between 3 to 3.10 per cent.&nbsp;What do you make of RBI&rsquo;s liquidity measures?&nbsp;Two measures have been implemented: a CRR cut and the injection of Rs 1.3-1.5 trillion of liquidity on a durable basis. These steps are positive because they have already cooled down the borrowing market. With expectations of a rate cut, there will be a further reset of liability cost structures. These measures will enhance the system&rsquo;s liquidity profile, enabling banks to lend more to the market. As a result, we are on track to achieve a GDP growth of nearly 6.6 per cent for the full year.&nbsp;Do you think RBI will cut rates in the upcoming monetary policy meeting?&nbsp;We, as a market, always hope for a rate cut and going by the liquidity measures taken, there is a likely hood of a rate cut. Our house view is that in the calendar year, there will be three cuts, with one cut happening in February itself.&nbsp;Do you think the RBI will announce another round of CRR cuts?&nbsp;The goal is to ensure durable liquidity, which is why the RBI announced both the CRR cut and liquidity infusion measures. With these actions, the impact is expected to be significantly positive across several areas, including NIM, liquidity, and borrowing. This is a highly favourable development for the entire system.&nbsp;What is the ideal Retail Agriculture MSME (RAM): Corporate book you want to achieve and by when?&nbsp;Looking at the December quarter, retail growth has been impressive, reaching nearly 20 per cent. For MSME and Agri, growth has also shown strong improvement, with an increase of almost 200 bps compared to the September quarter. As we continue to grow faster in the RAM segment, the mix will naturally shift more towards RAM. For the full year, we expect a 10 per cent growth in our corporate loan book. With retail growth at 20 per cent Y-o-Y and MSME/Agri growth around 14-15 per cent, we will continue to shift the balance more toward RAM. In the next 2-3 years, we aim to achieve a 65:35 mix between RAM and the corporate book.&nbsp;Your credit deposit (CD) ratio is elevated. Will you calibrate loan growth, given how the deposit market is to keep your CD ratio at a comfortable level?&nbsp;We expect to operate with a domestic CD ratio between 80-82 per cent on the domestic front, and the global CD ratio would be between 82-84 per cent, as the overseas market typically has a higher CD due to its structure. When we project an 11 per cent growth in deposits and a 13 per cent growth in advances, it would result in a CD ratio close to 84 per cent. There are two key factors to consider here: first, our excess SLR is around 6.7 per cent, so we don&rsquo;t need to allocate additional funds to the SLR. Second, our LCR is at 130 per cent, meaning we don&rsquo;t need to hold additional liquid assets to meet the LCR requirement. Given these factors, maintaining an 11 per cent deposit growth, 13 per cent advances growth, and an 84 per cent CD ratio is achievable. This is the range we plan to operate within, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve consistently communicated.", "keywords": ["Budget 2025", "Bank of Baroda", "Bank of Baroda lending rate"], "date": "2025-02-02T23:28:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020200416", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:42:03"},

Thirdly, credit costs may remain steady as the corporate asset quality cycle is benign at present.&nbsp;&quot;That said, we estimate sub-1 per cent RoA levels for FY26/27E.

This, along with modest loan-deposit ratio (LDR; 83 per cent) and liquidity coverage ratio (LCR; 130 per cent) provides leeway for growth. A higher MCLR book at 47 per cent vs peers should support margins.

In comparison, the BSE Sensex ended 0.01 per cent higher at 74,612.43 on Thursday.&nbsp;UltraTech, in an exchange filing on February 25, after market hours, said its proposed entry into this segment of the construction value chain, through its Building Products Division, aligns with the company&rsquo;s strategy to strengthen its position as a comprehensive building solutions provider.&nbsp;The company will set up its first plant in Bharuch (Gujarat), expected to be commissioned by December 2026. It aims to meet the growing demand for wires and cables across various sectors, including residential, commercial, infrastructure, and industrial applications.&nbsp;According to the company, the W&C industry has witnessed a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 13 per cent between 2018-19 and 2023-24.&nbsp;The company believes its entry into the sector is likely to be value-accretive for shareholders.&nbsp;Analysts at CLSA believe that, given its higher dependence on retail (housing) and a shorter time to market, UltraTech will focus more on wires than cables. For the W&C industry, the segment will need to grow at an 11-13 per cent CAGR over the next four to five years to absorb the announced expansion by incumbents and new players. Weaker growth could weigh on the sector&rsquo;s profitability over the medium term, the brokerage firm said.&nbsp;Analysts believe that, given UltraTech&rsquo;s retail focus and brand recall, it has a relatively higher chance of succeeding in wires than in cables. Also, cables require several approvals and tender wins, while wires have a faster time to market.&nbsp;India&rsquo;s W&C market is valued at \u20b980,000 crore ($9 billion), with two-thirds comprising cables and the rest wires. The market is relatively organised, with branded players accounting for 70 per cent of capacity. In the wire segment, 80 per cent of demand is driven by housing, with a higher reliance on new home construction.&nbsp;Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities expect that, like the paint industry, UltraTech may choose to aggressively invest in marketing and offer higher channel margins to establish its foothold in a market where the top five players command 45-50 per cent share. In the process, industry margins could be adversely impacted.&nbsp;Incumbents in the W&C industry are already in the midst of spending \u20b910,000 crore on capacity expansion over the next two to four years. Adding UltraTech&rsquo;s capital expenditure of \u20b91,800 crore (and assuming no further expansion by other players), at a 4-5x asset turn, the industry would need to grow at an 11-13 per cent CAGR over the next five years to absorb this capacity. If demand does not pick up to the same extent, it could weigh on the industry&rsquo;s profitability, CLSA said.&nbsp;Aggressive pricing, similar to its strategy in paints, and its early connect with real estate and infrastructure projects should aid in swift penetration. UltraTech could easily double down on its initial investment in the next phase, given its balance sheet and cash flows from the cement business, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said.&nbsp;Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services cut valuation multiples for W&C companies under their coverage &mdash; by 20 per cent for Polycab, KEI, and RR Kabel each, and by 10 per cent for Havells, given its diversified product portfolio and the highest total addressable market. The brokerage firm also believes UltraTech might initially see a mild negative reaction, as investors have traditionally viewed the company as a pure-play cement firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["polycab share price", "bse sensex", "sensex today", "Stock market rally", "Polycab India share", "KEI Industries", "Havells India", "R R Kabel", "UltraTech Cement", "wires & cables", "W&C segment", "Markets", "residential", "commercial", "infrastructure", "industrial applications", "market news"], "date": "2025-02-27T22:48:32+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022700192", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:42:25"},

Why buying a home in urban India feels financially draining", "content": "Many Indians, who want to own a house in urban areas, find it difficult to stretch their pockets and buy a decent accommodation due to increasing cost of the real estate in the country. This leads to a pertinent question- Why are homes in India so expensive?&nbsp;In a viral LinkedIn post, investment banker Sarthak Ahuja draws comparisons with global cities like New York, highlighting how a cocktail of regulatory constraints, market manipulation, and wealth concentration is keeping urban real estate prices sky-high.&nbsp;According to Ahuja, who is a partner at Sandeep Ahuja & Co, the Price to Income (P2I) ratio in Indian cities has reached a staggering 11, implying that it would take 11 years of a person&rsquo;s entire income to afford a house. For context, this is comparable to New York, one of the world&rsquo;s priciest real estate markets.&nbsp;&quot;Assuming half your income goes toward expenses, it would take over 20 years of savings just to afford a home,&quot; Ahuja points out.&nbsp;Also Read: How to invest in an uncertain market? Here is a defensive strategy by KIE&nbsp;Why are prices so high?&nbsp;Ahuja outlines three key factors&nbsp;Low floor space index (FSI):&nbsp;Indian metros typically allow FSIs ranging from 1.3 to 3.5, limiting vertical development. In contrast, cities like New York and Singapore permit FSIs of 15 and 25, respectively, allowing developers to build taller structures and house more people in less land. This lack of vertical growth in Indian cities artificially limits supply.&nbsp;Artificial scarcity by developers:&nbsp;Real estate developers often release only a fraction of units in new projects initially, typically just 5 out of 100. They then hike prices by 10 per cent for the next release to test market appetite, perpetuating a cycle of scarcity and price inflation.&nbsp;Black money and wealth concentration:&nbsp;&ldquo;It is said that less than 10 families own 20 per cent of the land in Mumbai,&rdquo; notes Ahuja, underscoring how India&rsquo;s wealthy elite use real estate to park black money. With much of their paper wealth locked in equity, real estate offers a tangible and tax-efficient asset class, further driving up demand and prices.&nbsp;So, should you still buy it?&nbsp;Ahuja recommends a conservative approach:&nbsp;Only consider buying a home if you can pay at least 50 per cent upfront and balance 50 per cent is financed through loan.&nbsp;Ensure your EMI doesn&rsquo;t exceed 35 per cent of your monthly take-home income.&nbsp;If that&rsquo;s not feasible, he suggests renting and focusing on increasing your active income. For those set on ownership, Tier-2 cities may offer better affordability and long-term value.&nbsp;Ahuja&rsquo;s post has struck a chord with many Indians navigating the real estate labyrinth. While urban housing remains a symbol of stability and success, the systemic issues surrounding Indian real estate call for deeper regulatory reforms and more transparent practices.&nbsp;Until then, as Ahuja succinctly puts it, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stretch yourself to buy a house just for the sake of ownership. Rent, save, invest, and grow your income first.&rdquo;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Indian housing market", "Urban Housing Crisis", "Real Estate India", "Home Buying Tips", "Property Prices", "Affordable Housing", "Personal Finance", "Why real estate is expensive in India", "urban housing crisis India", "price to income ratio Indian cities"], "date": "2025-04-08T14:20:10+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040800623", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:02"},

This marked the first such deportation flight under US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration. As the migrants landed back in India, many shared harrowing details of their journey through the &lsquo;dunki&rsquo; route, a dangerous and illegal method of crossing borders.&nbsp;Among the 104 deported Indians, there were 33 from Haryana, 33 from Gujarat, 30 from Punjab, three from Maharashtra, three from Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh. The group also included 19 women and 13 minors, with the youngest being a four-year-old boy.&nbsp;Many deportees remained unaware they were being sent back to India until just before departure. Speaking to news agency PTI, Singh, from Hardorwal village in Gurdaspur, recounted being handcuffed and shackled throughout the flight. Restraints were only removed upon arrival in Amritsar.&nbsp;Jaspal, another deportee, said he had paid Rs 30 lakh to an agent who assured him legal entry into the US. Instead, he found himself stranded in Brazil for six months before making the treacherous overland journey to the US, only to be arrested by Border Patrol and held in detention for 11 days.&nbsp;Harwinder Singh, from Hoshiarpur, described 15-hour boat rides, crossing 40-45 km on foot, and surviving near-drownings.&nbsp;The mass deportation signals the Trump administration&rsquo;s intensified crackdown on illegal immigration, particularly through the high-risk &lsquo;donkey route&rsquo; that many Indians continue to take in pursuit of the American dream. Here is a closer look at dunki and understanding what it entails.&nbsp;What is the &lsquo;dunki&rsquo; route?The term &lsquo;dunki&rsquo;, derived from the Punjabi idiom meaning &lsquo;to hop from place to place&rsquo;, refers to an illegal immigration technique known as &lsquo;donkey flights&rsquo;.&nbsp;This method involves crossing borders through a series of covert stops in multiple countries, often facilitated by agents who charge exorbitant fees. These agents may offer a range of services, from providing fake documents to smuggling individuals through ship containers or hidden compartments in vehicles.&nbsp;The process typically begins with migrants obtaining a tourist visa for European Union Schengen countries, allowing them to move freely across 26 nations. Once in the EU, consultants help them illegally enter countries like the UK or the US using forged documents or by hiding in vehicles.&nbsp;While the dunki method can be used to enter any country, the US, Canada, and the UK remain the most sought-after destinations for Indian migrants.&nbsp;Why risk the dunki route?Post-independence, many Indian families who migrated to developed nations found better social, economic, and political conditions, creating a lasting aspiration for others to follow suit. This trend has only intensified over the years, with both legal and illegal migration on the rise.&nbsp;The allure of a better life drives many to take these risks. The promise of higher incomes, greater opportunities, and an improved standard of living, often encapsulated in the idea of the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo;, fuels the desire to migrate. For many, this dream is worth the dangers and financial sacrifices.In other cases, migrants may be &ldquo;cheated&rdquo; by agents into crossing borders illegally after paying high fees.&nbsp;Some sell ancestral land or other assets to pay agents, only to find themselves exploited further. Agents often withhold passports or demand additional payments, leaving migrants vulnerable and trapped.&nbsp;The dunki route, what it entails, reason why people may embark on it, and what they may find after entering a foreign country was detailed in Raj Kumar Hirani&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dunki&rsquo;, a 2023 Bollywood film starring Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, and Boman Irani.&nbsp;Indians fifth-largest group of US illegal migrantsAccording to the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), Indians are the fifth-largest group of illegal migrants entering the US via its southwest border. Between October 2022 and September 2023, nearly 97,000 Indians were caught attempting to cross illegally, with over 30,000 detained at the Canada border and 41,770 at the Mexico border. The majority of these migrants hail from Punjab and Gujarat, states with a long history of migration to Western countries.&nbsp;Risks of illegal migrationThe &lsquo;dunki route&rsquo; is fraught with dangers. Migrants face the risk of capture, imprisonment, and deportation, as was the case in the US. The journey itself is perilous, with harsh weather conditions, rugged terrains, and limited access to food and water.&nbsp;Many also fall victim to exploitation, with agents extorting money or abandoning them mid-journey. While migrant smuggling is distinct from human trafficking, the two crimes can intersect, further endangering those involved. Recent deportation flights also show that these perilous journeys can sometimes amount to nothing.", "keywords": ["dunki", "dunki route", "what is dunki route", "why people choose dunki route", "dunki route agents", "illegal immigrations", "border crossing"], "date": "2025-02-06T11:16:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020600326", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:02"},

Trump claims that many countries have higher tariffs on US imports than the United States does on theirs, creating an uneven playing field that disadvantages US manufacturing.&nbsp;Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump made a campaign promise stating: &ldquo;An eye for an eye, a tariff for a tariff, same exact amount.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Every country will be reciprocal,&rdquo; Trump remarked on Sunday.&nbsp;This idea is not new; during his first term, Trump&#39;s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, suggested increasing tariffs to align with the import taxes of other nations, with plans to reduce them only once those countries did the same.Trump&rsquo;s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, stated that the proposals could be finalised by early April.However, this approach carries potential risks. Heavier tariffs on imports could lead to increased inflation in the US, the world&rsquo;s largest economy, while also slowing down economic growth in other nations.&nbsp;How will the tariffs be structured?Trump&rsquo;s reciprocal tariffs will be tailored to each trading partner, as reported by Bloomberg, referencing a White House memo. These tariffs aim to address perceived unfair trade practices, including excessive regulations, value-added taxes (VAT), exchange rate manipulation, and inadequate intellectual property protection.&nbsp;The tariffs could be applied in several forms, such as targeting specific products, entire industries, or a general tariff on all goods from a particular country. In some cases, the US might reduce tariffs in response to positive actions from other countries, though this remains uncertain.&nbsp;How did India respond to Trump&rsquo;s tariff call?Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to initiate discussions on trade and tariff-related matters, as confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.&nbsp;During a press briefing following a meeting between PM Modi and Trump at the White House, Misri said, &ldquo;We have indicated, and the two leaders have agreed today to start discussing trade and tariff-related issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;He further added, &ldquo;So, I will let those discussions begin before commenting on what may unfold with regard to the plans announced today by the US administration.&rdquo;&nbsp;Before he met with PM Modi, Trump declared reciprocal tariffs on countries, including India. &ldquo;On trade, I have decided that for fairness, I&rsquo;ll charge reciprocal tariffs &mdash; meaning, whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them &mdash; no more, no less. They charge us with tax and tariffs, it&rsquo;s very simple we will charge them with exact tax and tariffs,&rdquo; Trump explained.&nbsp;Which countries would be most affected by the tariffs?Emerging markets like India, Argentina, and many nations in Africa and Southeast Asia are expected to be hit hardest by these tariffs, according to the report.

The incident, latest in the decades-old dispute, has led to the bus services between the two states coming to a standstill.&nbsp;The dispute dates back to the linguistic reorganisation of Indian states in 1956 and remains unresolved to date. Here&rsquo;s a closer look.&nbsp;Origins of dispute&nbsp;Following India&rsquo;s independence in 1947, the Belgaum (now Belagavi) district, a region with a multilingual population which was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, became a focal point of linguistic and territorial disputes. In 1948, the Belgaum municipality requested that the region be merged with Maharashtra, claiming that it had a predominantly Marathi population.&nbsp;To resolve this and other boundary disputes, the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956, which redrew state boundaries based on linguistic demographics. Under this act, Belgaum was merged into Karnataka (then Mysore State). The Act included recommendations by the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC), chaired by Justice Fazal Ali, which was established in 1953.&nbsp;The panel, which published its report in 1955, recommended that the Belgaum district, which includes the city of Belgaum and surrounding areas, remain a part of the then Mysore State. This decision was influenced by factors such as administrative convenience, economic links, and the linguistic composition of the region.&nbsp;While the panel acknowledged the presence of both Marathi and Kannada-speaking populations in the border areas, it emphasised that linguistic factors should not be the sole criterion for redrawing state boundaries. The commission considered a combination of administrative efficiency, economic viability, and the wishes of the people in making its recommendations.&nbsp;&ldquo;If as many as nine out of the eleven taluks go to Karnataka (Chandgad going to Bombay and Belgaum being disputed), then, on administrative grounds, the Belgaum town, which is the district headquarters, along with the Belgaum taluk, should also go to Karnataka,&rdquo; the panel noted in its report.&nbsp;However, Maharashtra has long claimed the region, arguing that Marathi-speaking areas, including Belgaum and surrounding villages, should rightfully be part of its territory.&nbsp;Mahajan Commission report&nbsp;To address the dispute, the central government in 1966 established the Mahajan Commission, led by former Chief Justice of India Mehr Chand Mahajan. The commission&rsquo;s report, submitted in 1967, made several key recommendations:&nbsp;1. The commission recommended that Belgaum city and 247 surrounding villages remain within Karnataka.&nbsp;2. It proposed that 264 villages, including areas like Nippani, Khanapur, and Nandagad, be transferred to Maharashtra.&nbsp;Maharashtra rejected the report, terming it &quot;biased and illogical,&quot; while Karnataka welcomed it.&nbsp;Legal and political disputes&nbsp;The dispute took a legal turn in 2004 when Maharashtra filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging Karnataka&rsquo;s control over the region. While the case remains pending, the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly passed a unanimous resolution in 2022 asserting its claim over Belagavi and other Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka.&nbsp;Maharashtra has also lent support to pressure groups such as Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES). In December 2024, Maharashtra objected to the arrest of several MES workers for opposing the Karnataka legislature session in Belagavi.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Karnataka has repeatedly asserted its claim by holding legislative sessions in Belagavi. The state has also dissolved Belagavi City Corporation multiple times for passing resolutions favouring the merger of Belagavi with Maharashtra.&nbsp;In 2022, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde fuelled the dispute by announcing welfare schemes for freedom fighters in Belagavi and other Marathi-speaking regions in Karnataka. In response, then Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai announced grants for Kannada schools in Maharashtra.&nbsp;What is the latest dispute?&nbsp;On February 21, a Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus conductor was allegedly assaulted for not speaking in Marathi in Belagavi&rsquo;s Marihal area. The altercation began when a 17-year-old girl and her companion boarded the bus and demanded the conductor speak Marathi. When he expressed his inability to do so, tensions escalated, leading to the conductor&rsquo;s assault by a gathered crowd. Four people, including the girl, were detained.&nbsp;In response to the assault on the KSRTC conductor, pro-Kannada activists targeted Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses. In Chitradurga, Karnataka, activists halted an MSRTC bus, defaced it, and blackened the driver&rsquo;s face while chanting slogans.&nbsp;Due to these incidents, interstate bus services between Maharashtra and Karnataka remain suspended for the second consecutive day on February 24.", "keywords": ["maharashtra karnataka border dispute", "maharashtra karnataka border dispute history", "maharashtra karnataka bus", "maharashtra karnataka bus dispute", "maharashtra karnataka bus services suspended", "maharashtra karnataka bus news", "belagavi dispute", "belagavi dispute", "belagavi border dispute"], "date": "2025-02-24T17:23:27+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022400735", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:04"},

The protest, organised by members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), took place in front of Kempegowda Metro Station on Friday afternoon, following up to 100 per cent fare hikes of Namma Metro.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s what is known about the fare hike, protests, and resolution.&nbsp;Bengaluru metro hikes fare, removes discountsOn February 9, 2025, BMRCL announced increase in travel fares of Namma Metro, Bengaluru&rsquo;s metro system.The fare adjustments include an increase in the maximum fare to Rs 90 from Rs 60, while the minimum fare for journeys covering the shortest distance (0-2 km) remained unchanged at Rs 10.&nbsp;However, fares for other distances, such as those between 2-4 km and for routes longer than 30 km, had risen by Rs 5-Rs 30. In addition, discounts previously available to QR code users had been removed, with only smart card users receiving a reduced discount of 5 per cent.&nbsp;The minimum balance for smart cards were raised to Rs 90 from Rs 50, while off-peak travel during certain hours offers an additional 5 per cent discount.&nbsp;Why were the metro fares hiked?This fare hike was the first in seven years for the city&rsquo;s metro system. The BMRCL justified the fare revision by citing a report from the fare fixation committee (FFC), which was formed in 2024 by the Union government. The committee, led by a former High Court judge, recommended fare increases based on operational costs, feedback from passengers, and expert consultations.&nbsp;Congress, BJP blame each other for fare hikeThe fare revision, which led to price hikes of up to 100 per cent in some cases, triggered strong reactions from commuters, politicians, and mobility experts. The fare changes also led to heated debates, with political parties accusing each other of responsibility and a public outcry over the impact on daily passengers.&nbsp;The Congress and the Opposition BJP exchanged blame, with both parties accusing the other of influencing the decision for the far hike.&nbsp;BJP leaders, including Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya, demanded a rollback, while condemning the Congress-led state government for burdening citizens with the fare increase. Meanwhile, the Congress pointed to the BJP-led central government, claiming that the fare hike was a result of recommendations from the central government&rsquo;s fare fixation committee.&nbsp;CM Siddaramaiah calls for rollback on faresFollowing public outcry, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on February 14 directed the BMRCL to reduce fares where the increases were excessive.&nbsp;Siddaramaiah had initially claimed that the state government had no control over the fare revision, as BMRCL operates as a joint venture between the Centre and the State. However, as pressures mounted he called a rollback on certain fares, calling the hike &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo;.&nbsp;On the same day, BMRCL announced a fare revision, capping the maximum hike at 71 per cent and offering reductions for certain routes. The new fare structure, which took effect on February 14, 2025, was intended to address commuter concerns while still adhering to the original recommendations of the fare fixation committee.&nbsp;Protests outside Bengaluru metroDespite the rollback, discontent continued among the public with ABVP organising protests outside the metro stations.&nbsp;The Cottonpet police initiated a suo motu case after receiving complaints regarding the protest.&nbsp;Authorities informed the protesters that the Karnataka High Court&rsquo;s March 3, 2022, order prohibits demonstrations and processions outside Freedom Park. Despite this, the activists allegedly ignored the court&rsquo;s directive and continued their protest. Following the escalation, senior police officers were notified, and additional police forces were deployed from Cottonpet and Upparpet stations.&nbsp;The protesters were subsequently detained. The FIR has been filed under various sections of the Karnataka Police Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including Section 189 (unlawful assembly), Section 190 (holding unlawful assembly members accountable for collective offenses), and Section 223 (disobedience of public orders).&nbsp;[With agency inputs]&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Bengaluru metro fare hike", "Namma Metro fare increase 2025", "Bengaluru metro protests", "BMRCL fare revision", "metro fare fixation committee India", "Bengaluru metro QR code discount removal", "Karnataka government metro fare rollback", "ABVP protests metro fare", "Bengaluru metro price increase", "CM Siddaramaiah metro fare decision", "Congress BJP blame game metro", "Karnataka High Court protest ban", "Bengaluru metro travel cost", "BMRCL smart card fare discount", "Bengaluru metro commuter outrage", "Bengaluru metro price hike", "bengaluru metro commuters news", "Bengaluru metro news today"], "date": "2025-02-17T14:12:03+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021700421", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:04"},

Industry executives argue that the deadline is impractical,&nbsp;highlighting challenges such as recycling infrastructure, material shortages, and cost concerns, especially with peak summer demand approaching, according to a report by&nbsp;The Economic Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverage giants including Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co, Bisleri, and Parle Agro are all impacted by these stringent deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued this directive over two years ago as part of India&rsquo;s Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules. However, beverage companies contend that the industry is not adequately prepared for the transition, despite the extended timeline.&nbsp;PET vs rPET bottlesPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, and rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) are both widely used in packaging and textiles, but they differ significantly in their environmental impact and production process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PET is a durable, lightweight plastic commonly found in beverage bottles, food containers, and synthetic fibres. Its strength and recyclability make it a popular choice, but it is primarily produced from fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, making its manufacturing process resource-intensive and environmentally demanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, rPET is an eco-friendlier alternative derived from recycled PET products. Post-consumer PET waste, such as plastic bottles, is collected, cleaned, and processed into flakes, which are then melted and repurposed into rPET pellets or resin. These materials are used to create new products like rPET packaging, rPET sheets, and rPET polyester fabrics, reducing reliance on virgin plastics and minimising waste.&nbsp;What is the govt mandate on PET bottles?To incentivise domestic recycling, India banned the import of plastic waste, including PET bottles in 2015. By 2016, however, the ban was amended, allowing plastic waste imports only for units located in special economic zones (SEZs).&nbsp;The Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 banned plastic sachets used for gutkha, tobacco, and pan masala due to high littering potential. Additionally, states/UTs were asked to form special task forces for eliminating single-use plastics (SUPs).&nbsp;Plastic packaging producers, e-commerce firms, and major SUPs users were directed to phase out SUPs. Compliance varied by state/UT, with some implementing partial bans while others enforced a complete ban.&nbsp;In 2019, the Environment Ministry imposed a full ban on plastic waste imports to strengthen India&rsquo;s waste management system and prevent the country from becoming a dumping ground. The Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Smriti Manch (PDUSM) campaign played a role in advocating for this decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;India allows PET waste imports&nbsp;The ban on PET bottle imports was lifted in 2021 after industries processing plastic waste reported shortages in India. Seven Indian companies applied to import 93,000 tonnes of PET bottle waste from the US, Canada, and Germany, citing insufficient domestic supply.&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change mandates that beverage makers use 30 per cent recycled plastic in rigid packaging, like PET bottles, starting April 1, 2025 with annual increases of 10 per cent to reach 60 per cent by financial year 2027-28 to 2028-29.&nbsp;Industry urges govt to adopt &lsquo;realistic targets&rsquo;Industry representatives, during a December meeting with the Central Pollution Control Board, argued that the 30 per cent threshold is too stringent due to the scarcity of rPET and urged the government to adopt more realistic targets, suggesting an initial 15 per cent obligation with gradual 5 per cent annual increases, the Hindu Bussinessline had earlier reported.&nbsp;Industry leaders say that despite ongoing investments, recycling capacity expansion takes 2-3 years. At present, only five Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)-approved plants are equipped to produce food-grade rPET, meeting just 15 per cent of industry demand.&nbsp;Affordability and regulatory concernsThe industry fears that bottling costs will surge by nearly 30 per cent, a portion of which may be passed on to consumers. Smaller companies, lacking resources to procure certified rPET, may resort to lower-quality recyclers, raising safety and regulatory concerns.&nbsp;Another challenge is that plastic bottles account for 70 per cent of beverage packaging, making them the most widely used option due to lower transport costs compared to glass and affordability over aluminium cans. The sudden shift to higher rPET content without sufficient infrastructure could disrupt supply chains.&nbsp;Govt response and legal issuesCiting officials, The Economic Times reported that the government is unlikely to extend the deadline, citing that companies have had sufficient time to comply. Industry executives, however, believe the rigid timeline could force them to seek an anticipatory stay in court, delaying implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["beverage giants", "india rpet bottle mandate", "rpet deadline April 2025", "Beverage companies PET bottles", "Indian beverage companies recycled PET bottles", "Indian government recycled PET bottles"], "date": "2025-02-26T11:36:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022600258", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:05"},

US President Donald Trump is pushing for a deal that would give the US partial access to the country&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp;Trump has said that Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth could be worth &ldquo;trillions of dollars&rdquo; and suggested that it should be used to offset the cost of US aid. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described the country&rsquo;s resources as &ldquo;priceless&rdquo; and is seeking security guarantees as part of any agreement.&nbsp;The growing demand for critical minerals and the global race to reduce reliance on China have heightened interest in Ukraine&rsquo;s deposits. But what are these minerals in Ukraine and what are they worth?&nbsp;What minerals does Ukraine have?Ukraine is believed to hold reserves of several rare earth elements, which are key materials used in military, technology, and renewable energy industries.&nbsp;Role of rare earth minerals in the militaryRare earths, a group of 17 chemically similar elements, are essential for manufacturing missiles, lasers, tanks, smartphones, and clean energy technologies.&nbsp;China currently dominates global rare earth processing, making alternative sources, such as those in Ukraine, particularly significant. However, while Ukraine is known to have some rare earth deposits, the full extent of these resources is unclear. Geological data from the Soviet era is outdated, and further surveys are needed to confirm the size and viability of these reserves.&nbsp;Scandium, one of Ukraine&rsquo;s rare earth elements, is used in military equipment and high-performance materials. Other rare earths found in the country include neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and yttrium, all of which are crucial for advanced technologies.&nbsp;What other critical minerals does Ukraine have?Beyond rare earths, Ukraine has reserves of several other critical minerals essential for defence and industrial production. These include:Titanium &ndash; Used in aerospace manufacturing and military applicationsGraphite &ndash; A key material in batteries and electric vehiclesLithium &ndash; Vital for rechargeable batteries and clean energy storageUranium &ndash; Crucial for nuclear energy production&nbsp;Ukraine&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources lie in occupied regionsIn addition to minerals, Ukraine has significant oil, natural gas, and coal reserves. However, much of its hydrocarbon wealth is in regions currently occupied by Russia. This includes offshore natural gas reserves near Crimea and coal deposits in eastern Ukraine. More than half of Ukraine&rsquo;s coal reserves and about 20 per cent of its natural gas fields are under Russian control.&nbsp;Moscow has even hinted at the possibility of granting the US access to these resources, further complicating negotiations.&nbsp;What are Ukraine&rsquo;s rare mineral reserves worth?Economists estimate that Ukraine&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources alone could be worth around $360 billion, as reported by NBC News. Meanwhile, broader estimates suggest that the country&rsquo;s total mineral and natural resource wealth could be valued in the trillions of dollars.&nbsp;As far as the rare earth minerals are concerned, extraction and processing challenges mean that the economic potential and exact value of these resources remains difficult to estimate.&nbsp;Trump has claimed that Ukraine could provide the US with $500 billion worth of rare earth minerals, but industry analysts dispute this figure. The entire global market for rare earths is estimated to be worth just $12 billion, according to NBC News, making Trump&rsquo;s valuation unrealistic.&nbsp;While Ukraine is known to have some rare earth deposits, the full extent of these resources is unclear.&nbsp; Much of the country&rsquo;s geological data dates back to the Soviet era and is considered unreliable. New surveys are needed to determine the full extent of Ukraine&rsquo;s rare earth deposits.&nbsp;Mining minerals: A major challenge in UkraineWhile Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth is attracting international interest, realising its full economic potential will not be straightforward. Extracting and processing these resources requires stable infrastructure, secure supply chains, and long-term investment, including rebuilding Ukraine&rsquo;s war-damaged power grid. The war in Ukraine has disrupted much of the country&rsquo;s industrial capacity, and restoring it will be a lengthy and expensive process.&nbsp;At present, no large-scale rare earth projects are underway in the country, and media reports estimate that it could take up to a decade to establish a functioning supply chain.&nbsp;Why does the US want Ukraine&rsquo;s rare minerals?Global competition for critical minerals has intensified, particularly as the transition to clean energy and advanced technology accelerates. Countries such as the US and European nations are looking to reduce their reliance on China for rare earth processing, and Ukraine&rsquo;s resources could play a role in diversifying supply chains.&nbsp;China currently dominates global rare earth processing, making alternative sources, such as those in Ukraine, particularly significant.&nbsp;Securing access to Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth could help the US reduce its dependence on China and Russia, both of which dominate global critical mineral supply chains. Washington has long viewed this reliance as a strategic vulnerability, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions. For Ukraine, leveraging its mineral wealth could bring economic benefits &ndash; but only if the right agreements are in place.&nbsp;During their meeting in Washington, the two leaders were expected to work out the details of a potential minerals deal. While their positions on the terms of the agreement differ &ndash; particularly on security commitments &ndash; both US and Ukrainian officials were keen to secure access to Ukraine&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp;Moscow has even hinted at the possibility of granting the US access to Ukraine&rsquo;s resources, further complicating negotiations.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Ukraine rare earth minerals", "US Ukraine mineral deal", "Ukraine critical minerals", "rare earths in Ukraine", "Ukraine titanium reserves", "Ukraine lithium deposits", "US critical mineral supply", "Ukraine mineral wealth", "China rare earth monopoly", "Ukraine Russia mineral conflict", "Ukraine mining challenges", "US mineral security", "clean energy minerals", "global mineral supply chain", "neodymium in Ukraine", "scandium reserves Ukraine", "graphite supply Ukraine", "Ukraine energy resources", "Ukraine natural gas reserves", "Ukraine war impact on mining", "US mineral independence", "European mineral security", "rare earth extraction Ukraine", "Ukraine titanium exports", "Donald trump Zelenskyy mineral deal"], "date": "2025-03-03T13:20:17+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030300434", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:05"},

The person writing the essay described themselves as part of a secret resistance to counter Trump&#39;s misguided impulses, and its publication touched off a leak investigation in Trump&#39;s first White House.Taylor later published a book under the pen name Anonymous and publicly revealed his identity days before the 2020 election.Trump said Wednesday that Taylor was like a traitor and that his writings about confidential meetings were like spying.I think he&#39;s guilty of treason,&quot; he said.Taylor responded by saying Trump had proved his point.Dissent isn&#39;t unlawful. It certainly isn&#39;t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path,&quot; he wrote on X.Trump named Krebs the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency but became angered with him after he declared the 2020 election that Trump lost to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.Krebs did not respond to a message seeking comment, but late Wednesday he shared on X a message he originally posted when he left government in 2020: Honored to serve. We did it right.Trump has falsely claimed he was cheated out of reelection in 2020 by widespread fraud, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states where he disputed his loss all affirmed Biden&#39;s victory. Judges, including some he appointed, rejected dozens of his legal challenges.It&#39;s bizarre to see a president investigate his own administration and his own appointee, said David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer and coauthor of The Big Truth, a book about Trump&#39;s 2020 election lies.Becker noted that Krebs issued his reassurances about the security of the upcoming election for months during 2020 without pushback from the then-president, with Trump only souring on him after the votes were counted.The reason he can sit in the White House today and govern from that position is because our election system is secure and has accurately determined who has won the presidency, Becker said.Susman Godfrey, the firm Trump targeted in an order Wednesday, represented Dominion Voting Systems in a lawsuit that accused Fox News of falsely claiming that the voting company had rigged the 2020 presidential election. Fox News ultimately agreed to pay nearly $800 million to avert a trial.The order bars the firm from using government resources or buildings, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf.In a statement, Susman Godfrey responded that people who know the firm know it takes seriously its duty to uphold the rule of law. This principle guides us now, the firm said. &quot;There is no question that we will fight this unconstitutional order.Trump has issued a series of orders meant to punish firms, including by ordering the suspension of lawyers&#39; security clearances and revoking federal contracts. He&#39;s succeeded in extracting concessions from some who have settled, but others have challenged the orders in court.", "keywords": ["donald trump", "Miles Taylor", "Department of Homeland Security official", "Chris Krebs", "a former top cybersecurity official"], "date": "2025-04-10T07:34:59+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000085", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:06"},

In the end, he had to hit pause, but vowed to try again Thursday.Don&#39;t doubt us, Johnson said, after a more than hourlong huddle with GOP lawmakers. Just give us a little space to do our work.Pushing the budget framework forward would log another milestone for Johnson, who had set a deadline of the congressional spring break recess Thursday for advancing the resolution. A failed vote, particularly as the economy was convulsing over Trump&#39;s trade wars, would be a major setback for the Republican agenda in Washington.Stop grandstanding! Trump had admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum on Tuesday night.Trump told the Republicans, Close your eyes and get there.But by Wednesday afternoon, the outcome was in flux. At least a dozen conservative Republicans stood firmly against the plan. Several of them, including leaders of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, made the unusual move of walking across the Capitol to meet privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts.As night fell, Johnson pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room off the House chamber. House proceedings came to a standstill.Johnson said he spoke with Trump for about five or six minutes in a side room while the GOP meeting was taking place. This is part of the process, Johnson said afterward.I&#39;m very optimistic about the outcome of this, this one big, beautiful bill,&#39; he said. We want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here, and we have a small subset of members who weren&#39;t totally satisfied with the product as it stands.But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remained concerned that the Senate GOP&#39;s blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.The Math Does Not Add Up, Rep Chip Roy posted on social media. He said he would not support it.Rep Andy Harris, the chair of the Freedom Caucus, led others to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Senate GOP leaders.Sen John Barrasso, the GOP whip, exited a short time later calling it a very positive meeting. &quot;The House and the Senate Republicans are all on the same page, and we&#39;re all committed to serious and significant savings for the American taxpayers, Barrasso said.Voting would provide another step in a process that will take weeks, if not months. The House and Senate must resolve their differences in a final product with more votes ahead later this spring or summer.Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.Pennsylvania Rep Brendan Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, said the proposed GOP budget cuts in either the House or Senate version would deeply harm Medicaid, the health care programme used by tens of millions of Americans.This will have a devastating impact on my district, my state and all 435 congressional districts throughout our land, Boyle said.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans&#39; budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy.We&#39;re here to make it clear, Jeffries said. Hands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.The budget framework starts the process of the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump&#39;s first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump&#39;s mass deportation operation and as much for the Defence Department to bolster military spending.It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session Maine Sen Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House&#39;s framework, while Kentucky Sen Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on fishy math that would add to the debt.The package would also boost the nation&#39;s debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 mid-term election.With Trump&#39;s trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action as the Senate has taken to disapprove of Trump&#39;s tariffs.", "keywords": ["Reconstruction Era", "Republican Party", "Republicanism in the United States", "Right-wing populism in the United States", "Congress", "final product", "John Barrasso", "social media", "Democratic Leader", "White House", "accounting method", "National Building Museum", "Andy Harris", "President", "United States", "Speaker", "whip", "Majority Leader", "Washington", "chair", "Paul", "Brendan Boyle", "House", "Defence Department", "Mike Johnson", "New York", "Donald Trump", "John Thune", "Susan Collins", "Senate", "Department of the Treasury", "Hakeem Jeffries", "Rand Paul", "Chip Roy"], "date": "2025-04-10T07:43:27+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000093", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:07"},

Sources had said very high possibility&quot; that Rana could be extradited shortly.The hugely significant development comes just days after Rana&#39;s last-resort attempt to evade extradition to India failed after the US Supreme Court justices denied his application, moving him closer to being handed over to Indian authorities to face justice in the dastardly attacks.Rana was lodged in the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Los Angeles and had submitted an Emergency Application For Stay Pending Litigation of Petition For Writ of Habeas Corpus&#39; on February 27, 2025 with Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit Elena Kagan. Kagan had denied the application earlier last month.Rana had then renewed his Emergency Application for Stay Pending Litigation of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus previously addressed to Justice Kagan&#39;, and requested that the renewed application be directed to US Chief Justice John Roberts.An order on the Supreme Court website had noted that Rana&#39;s renewed application has been distributed for Conference on April 4 and the application has been referred to the Court.A notice on the Supreme Court website Monday said that his application is &quot;denied&quot; by the court.In his emergency application, Rana had sought a stay of his extradition and surrender to India pending litigation (including exhaustion of all appeals) on the merits of his February 13, 2025 petition for a writ of habeas corpus asserting, inter alia, that his extradition to India violates United States law implementing the terms of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, because there are substantial grounds for believing that, if extradited to India, petitioner will be in danger of being subjected to torture.The likelihood of torture in this case is even higher though as petitioner faces acute risk as a Muslim of Pakistani origin charged in the Mumbai attacks, the application said.The application also said that his severe medical conditions render extradition to Indian detention facilities a de facto&quot; death sentence in this case.It cited medical records from July 2024 that confirm Rana has multiple acute and life-threatening diagnoses, including multiple documented heart attacks, Parkinson&#39;s disease with cognitive decline, a mass suggestive of bladder cancer, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and a history of chronic asthma, and multiple COVID-19 infections.Accordingly, petitioner certainly has raised a credible, if not compelling, factual case that there are indeed substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of torture if surrendered to Indian authorities.&quot;Further, because of his Muslim religion, his Pakistani origin, his status as a former member of the Pakistani Army, the relation of the putative charges to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and his chronic health conditions he is even more likely to be tortured than otherwise would be the case, and that torture is very likely to kill him in short order.The US Supreme Court denied Rana&#39;s petition for writ of certiorari relating to his original habeas petition on January 21, 2025. The application notes that on that same day, newly-confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio had met with External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Washington on February 12 to meet with US President Donald Trump, Rana&#39;s counsel received a letter from the Department of State, stating that on February 11, 2025, the Secretary of State decided to authorize Rana&#39;s &quot;surrender to India, pursuant to the Extradition Treaty between the United States and India.Rana&#39;s Counsel requested from the State Department the complete administrative record on which Secretary Rubio based his decision to authorise Rana&#39;s surrender to India. The Counsel also requested immediate information of any commitment the United States has obtained from India with respect to Rana&#39;s treatment. The government declined to provide any information in response to these requests, the application said.It added that given Rana&#39;s underlying health conditions and the State Department&#39;s own findings regarding treatment of prisoners, it is very likely that he will not survive long enough to be tried in India.During a joint press conference with Prime Minister Modi in the White House in February, President Trump had announced that his administration has approved the extradition of &quot;very evil&quot; Tahawwur Rana, wanted by Indian law enforcement agencies for his role in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, &quot;to face justice in India.The India-US joint statement issued during the Prime Minister&#39;s visit to US notes that Modi and Trump reaffirmed that the global scourge of terrorism must be fought and terrorist safe havens eliminated from every corner of the world.Recognising a shared desire to bring to justice those who would harm our citizens, the US announced that the extradition to India of Tahawwur Rana has been approved. The leaders further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.&quot;The leaders also pledged to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and to deny access to such weapons by terrorists and non-state actors, the joint statement said.On November 26, 2008, a group of 10 Pakistani terrorists went on a rampage, carrying out a coordinated attack on a railway station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, after they sneaked into India&#39;s financial capital using the sea route in the Arabian Sea.As many as 166 people were killed in the nearly 60-hour assault that sent shockwaves across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.", "keywords": ["Antisemitism in India", "Tahawwur Hussain Rana", "Mumbai attacks", "Rana", "Federal Bureau of Prisons", "David Headley", "Metropolitan Detention Center", "Los Angeles", "Chief Justice", "Department of State", "S Jaishankar", "Arabian Sea", "official at the agency", "official", "counsel", "Prime Minister", "US Supreme Court", "White House", "chronic health conditions", "Metropolitan Detention Centre in Los Angeles", "John Roberts", "President", "United Nations", "Bureau of Prisons", "Pakistan", "David Coleman Headley", "United States", "Narendra Modi", "newly-confirmed Secretary", "bladder cancer", "Daood Gilani", "Parkinson's disease", "Washington", "Pathankot", "documented heart attacks", "External Affairs Minister", "chronic kidney disease", "Elena Kagan", "Mumbai", "Metropolitan Detention Centre", "Secretary", "Secretary of State", "India", "infections", "Pakistani Army", "chronic asthma", "correctional/criminal justice system/law enforcement entity", "Parkinson", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Hussain Rana"], "date": "2025-04-10T08:00:08+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000094", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:11"},

While there are signs of improvement led by targeted government efforts, a shift in attitude towards &lsquo;work&rsquo; among young Chinese has gained momentum over the past few years. While the west grapples with notions of &lsquo;quiet quitting&rsquo; or &lsquo;quiet vacationing&rsquo;, the shift on the east is best represented by the &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Let it rot&rsquo; movement, where young people are actively rejecting societal pressures to overwork and pursue conventional success.&nbsp;The &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; movement seems to stem from the &lsquo;Tang Ping&rsquo; movement, which gained prominence in 2021. Here is a look at how the youth of China have been dealing with disappointing market conditions over the last few years.&nbsp;What is &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo;?The term &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; literally means &ldquo;let it rot&rdquo;. It describes a mindset of voluntary retreat, where individuals choose not to fight against a difficult situation because they believe it is beyond their control. The phrase reflects growing disillusionment among young Chinese who feel that despite their efforts, economic and social success remains out of reach.&nbsp;This movement is closely related to another trend called &ldquo;Tang Ping&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lying flat&rdquo;. First gaining prominence in 2021, Tang Ping represents a rejection of excessive ambition and relentless work culture. Those who embrace it refuse to chase high-paying, high-stress jobs, instead opting for a low-desire lifestyle where they work only enough to meet their basic needs.&nbsp;Why are Chinese youth embracing &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tang Ping&rsquo;?According to media reports, several key factors explain the rise of these movements:&nbsp;Harsh job market: With high youth unemployment and an uncertain economy, many young people see little benefit in striving for career success.&nbsp;The 996 work culture: Many white-collar workers face a brutal schedule of 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, yet still struggle to afford housing, marriage, or a better quality of life.&nbsp;Soaring cost of living: Skyrocketing property prices and living expenses make it difficult for young people to achieve financial security.&nbsp;Lack of upward mobility: Many believe that no matter how hard they work, real success remains out of reach, especially for those from middle and lower-income backgrounds.&nbsp;For some, Bai Lan and Tang Ping are acts of silent resistance &ndash; a way to push back against societal expectations that demand endless productivity while offering little in return.&nbsp;How has the Chinese govt responded?China&rsquo;s leadership sees Bai Lan and Tang Ping as serious threats to economic growth and social stability. The government has responded with:Public campaigns promoting hard work: Officials have repeatedly emphasised the importance of hard work, ambition, and dedication to China&rsquo;s future.Job creation and policy reforms: Efforts to boost employment opportunities and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation are being introduced.Education reforms: Authorities are considering ways to align education with evolving job markets, pushing students towards practical and diverse career paths.However, these measures have met with mixed reactions. While some believe they are necessary to stabilise the economy, others argue that they are outdated solutions that fail to address the frustrations of young people.&nbsp;To motivate the youth, President Xi Jinping, in 2022, delivered an address outlining the role of the youth in &lsquo;national rejuvenation&rsquo;. He called on young people to channel their energy and creativity to the nation&rsquo;s development, emphasising their role in achieving the &lsquo;Chinese Dream&rsquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;For generations of youths in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realise their dreams,&rdquo; Jinping said.&nbsp;Is a larger cultural shift at play in China?The Bai Lan movement is not just about unemployment, it signals a major cultural shift in how young Chinese view work, success, and personal happiness.&nbsp;Traditional values that once emphasised stable jobs, marriage, and children are now being questioned, reflecting changing family and social expectations. Social media platforms, like Weibo and Douyin (China&rsquo;s version of TikTok), have also played a role in spreading the Bai Lan mindset, connecting like-minded individuals who embrace this outlook.&nbsp;However, if more young people continue to opt out of the workforce or reject the pursuit of high-paying careers, it could have long-term economic consequences, deepening challenges and widening income disparities.&nbsp;What is the unemployment rate in China?China&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate, which soared to a record high of 21.3 per cent in June 2023 due to a prolonged economic slowdown, has shown signs of improvement in recent months. Official data indicates that the rate declined for the third consecutive month in November 2024, suggesting a gradual easing of pressure in the job market. However, uncertainty among the youth appears to persist.&nbsp;On Wednesday, the Chinese government reported that in 2024, the country successfully created 12.56 million new urban jobs, achieving its annual goal. Earlier, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China noted that the surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 per cent last year, a slight improvement from 2023.&nbsp;For 2025, China has set its surveyed urban unemployment rate target at around 5.5 per cent.&nbsp;Despite these positive indicators, broader demographic challenges remain. For instance, marriage registrations in 2024 fell to their lowest level since 1980, reflecting deeper population concerns that could have long-term economic implications.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Bai Lan movement China", "Tang Ping movement China", "China youth unemployment", "Bai Lan let it rot", "China work culture crisis", "Chinese youth job market", "996 work culture China", "Xi Jinping youth employment", "Bai Lan vs Tang Ping", "China economic slowdown impact", "youth disillusionment China", "Chinese Dream vs Bai Lan", "China labor market reforms", "Weibo Bai Lan discussions", "social resistance in China", "China job creation 2025", "Chinese youth cultural shift", "China marriage rate decline", "China work-life balance debate", "Douyin Bai Lan discussions", "silent protest China workforce", "China urban unemployment rate", "world news"], "date": "2025-03-05T17:08:08+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030500829", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:12"},

The rebels meanwhile aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.The 13 killed in strikes Tuesday night around Hodeida&#39;s al-Hawak district made it one of the deadliest single incidents in the ongoing American campaign, the rebels said. Another 15 people were wounded. The Houthis described the majority of those killed as women and children, without providing a breakdown.The area is home to the city&#39;s airport, which the rebels have used in the past to target shipping in the Red Sea.Since its start, the intense campaign of US airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters related to the Israel-Hamas war has killed over 100 people, according to casualty figures released Wednesday by the Houthis.Footage aired by the rebels&#39; al-Masirah satellite news channel showed chaotic scenes of people carrying wounded to waiting ambulances and rescuers searching by the light of their mobile phones. The target appeared in the footage to be a home in a residential neighbourhood, likely part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders.Early Thursday morning, the Houthis said airstrikes targeting the al-Sabeen District in the south of the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, killed at least three people. The area is home to al-Sabeen Square and a major mosque that has been a gathering point for months for Houthi demonstrations against the war in the Gaza Strip. Other strikes hit the capital as well.More airstrikes hit Kamaran Island in the Red Sea, the Houthis said.The US military&#39;s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorisation from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15.The American military also hasn&#39;t been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that America was not going to relent in its campaign targeting the Houthis.Oil shipments targeted as US drone reportedly shot down&nbsp;On Wednesday, the State Department said the US will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organisations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports. That likely will further squeeze the rebels, who already have had problems in their territory with bad gasoline destroying vehicle engines.The Houthis also aired footage of the burning wreckage of what they described as an MQ-9 Reaper drone shot down in Yemen&#39;s al-Jawaf governorate. One man poked at the debris with a stick as those gathered chanted the Houthis&#39; slogan: God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.Central Command said it was aware of the report of the shoot down, but declined to answer further.The Houthis say they shoot down the drones with locally made missiles. The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 capable of downing aircraft.Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 metres) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the US military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen.The Houthis claim they&#39;ve shot down 22 MQ-9s over the country over the years, with 18 downed during the rebels&#39; campaign over the Israel-Hamas war.The US military hasn&#39;t acknowledged the total number of drones it has lost there.US airstrikes under Trump more intense than those under Biden&nbsp;An AP review has found the new US operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting Israeli ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.The US campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear programme as well.", "keywords": ["US airstrikes", "Yemen", "Houthis", "Houthi rebels", "death toll", "airstrikes"], "date": "2025-04-10T08:42:24+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000116", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:13"},

Here is a closer examination of the industrial competition in China and how &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; comes into play.&nbsp;What is Neijuan?The term &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; best translates to &lsquo;involution&rsquo; and can be better understood as &lsquo;involutionary competition&rsquo;. It describes a cycle of diminishing returns caused by intense competition. In simple terms, it means companies and individuals are forced to work harder and invest more, without seeing proportional benefits or returns.&nbsp;In business, this means companies slashing prices and overproducing to stay ahead, even if it hurts profitability.&nbsp;For workers, it describes a relentless rat race where individuals must continuously upskill, work long hours, and compete fiercely &ndash; without necessarily improving their quality of life.&nbsp;Chinese crack down on NeijuanNeijuan has been particularly visible in China&rsquo;s booming industries, where companies are undercutting each other in price wars, leading to lower profits and unsustainable business practices. The electric vehicle (EV) sector is a prime example, with fierce competition among brands driving aggressive price cuts.&nbsp;Response of Chinese govtThis is not the first time China&rsquo;s leaders have spoken about &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo;, but it is the first time it has been included in an official government work report. Over the past year, Beijing has intensified efforts to curb excessive competition and encourage more sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;Policy reforms: China aims to eliminate market fragmentation and local protectionism, making it easier for businesses to compete fairly.&nbsp;Stricter regulations: The government has pledged to crack down on destructive competition, ensuring industries focus on innovation rather than just price wars.&nbsp;Meetings with key industries: China&rsquo;s market regulator recently called in top companies from the technology, solar, and automotive sectors to discuss solutions for controlling &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo;.&nbsp;Promoting &lsquo;new quality productive forces&rsquo;: Beijing is shifting focus to high-tech sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and batteries, but overproduction remains a challenge.&nbsp;&ldquo;China will accelerate the establishment and improvement of fundamental institutional rules, eliminate local protectionism and market fragmentation, and remove bottlenecks in market entry and exit as well as resource allocation,&rdquo; Li stated during his address.&nbsp;Global competition ups pressure on Chinese firmsThe crackdown on &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; also comes amid rising tensions with the US and the European Union (EU). Western nations have accused China of &lsquo;dumping&rsquo; excess capacity into global markets, selling products at extremely low prices, which they claim is hurting their domestic industries.&nbsp;China, however, rejects these accusations, arguing that its industrial expansion is driven by innovation and genuine demand, not unfair trade practices. However, Beijing&rsquo;s increasing focus on regulating its industries suggests that even Chinese leaders are recognising the risks of unchecked competition.", "keywords": ["China neijuan crackdown", "neijuan industrial competition", "China excessive competition reforms", "Chinese Premier Li Qiang NPC speech", "China price wars regulation", "China economic slowdown policies", "neijuan electric vehicle market", "China anti-dumping accusations", "China market protectionism", "China business environment reforms", "China fair competition policies", "Chinese government work report neijuan", "China new quality productive forces", "China market entry and exit rules", "Beijing industrial regulation", "China business sustainability push", "China EU US trade tensions", "China overproduction crackdown", "Chinese market fragmentation reforms", "world news"], "date": "2025-03-05T18:10:13+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030500886", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:14"},

Tarigami, without naming Muralitharan, called for a clarification from the government.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am told a former Sri Lankan cricketer has been allotted land, which is an evacuee property, that too without [the cricketer] paying any penny.

Arora, founder and chief investment officer of Helios Capital, voiced his concerns at the Business Standard Manthan Summit 2025, arguing that the tax policy is discouraging foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and driving them away from Indian markets.&nbsp;But why is it causing investor concerns? To grasp the issue, it&rsquo;s important to understand what capital gains tax is and how it works.&nbsp;What is capital gains tax?When individuals or entities sell certain capital assets &ndash; such as stocks, mutual funds, property, gold, or other investments &ndash; they make a capital gain (profit) on the sale. If these assets were held for over a year, the profit is classified as a long-term capital gain and is taxed accordingly.&nbsp;What are the types of capital gains tax?Capital gains tax is categorised into short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG), depending on the holding period of the asset.&nbsp;Short-term capital gains (STCG): This tax applies when an asset is sold within a short duration after purchase. It is generally taxed at a higher rate.&nbsp;Long-term capital gains (LTCG): This tax applies when an asset is held for an extended period before being sold. It is typically taxed at a lower rate to encourage long-term investment.&nbsp;What is the STCG in India?STCG apply when assets like stocks, mutual funds, real estate, or other capital assets are sold within a short holding period &mdash; typically less than one year for equities and less than two years for real estate.&nbsp;In India, STCG on equity-oriented investments (where Securities Transaction Tax is paid) is taxed at 15 per cent, while STCG from other assets is taxed as per the investor&rsquo;s income tax slab rate.&nbsp;How to calculate STCG?Short-term capital gains (STCG) are calculated by subtracting the cost of acquisition, cost of improvement (if any), and any expenses related to the sale from the selling price of the asset. The formula is:STCG = Sale Price &ndash; (Purchase Price + Improvement Cost + Transfer Expenses)&nbsp;What is the LTCG in India?In India, LTCG on stocks and equity-oriented mutual funds is taxed at 12.5 per cent (plus surcharge and cess) for profits exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per year. However, LTCG was not applicable on equity until 2018 for gains up to Rs 1 lakh.&nbsp;The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced a major shift in capital gains taxation, increasing the LTCG tax rate to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent and eliminating the indexation benefit that previously allowed investors to adjust the purchase price of assets for inflation.&nbsp;Last year&rsquo;s Budget also called for equal tax treatment for foreign and domestic investors. There are no changes to the taxation of long-term capital gains (LTCG) derived from residential property in the new Income Tax Bill 2025.&nbsp;How to calculate LTCGThe taxable amount under LTCG is determined by subtracting the cost of acquisition from the sale price, and in the case of property or other high-value assets, certain transaction costs like brokerage or legal fees can be deducted before applying the tax.&nbsp;Why are investors worried?The elimination of indexation benefits has been particularly controversial. Previously, indexation allowed taxpayers to adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, effectively reducing taxable gains. By removing this benefit, the new tax structure could increase the tax burden on investors, especially those selling property, gold, and unlisted assets.&nbsp;Foreign investors, in particular, have been hit hard by these changes. Speaking at the Business Standard annual summit Arora of Helios Capital argued that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) &ndash; which form a significant portion of foreign investment &ndash; are now disincentivised from investing in India.&nbsp;&ldquo;The biggest mistake they (the government) have made, the biggest souring of sentiment, and reality which they have to accept is capital gains tax in India, particularly the foreign investors, is 100 per cent wrong,&rdquo; Arora said. &ldquo;The largest investors in the world and in India are foreign sovereign funds, pension funds, universities, and the HNIs. Taxing them on their gains, especially when they have no tax set-off available in their home country and when they face forex-related risks, is a big mistake that the government is making.&rdquo;&nbsp;How has this impacted the Indian market?Since October 2024, foreign investors have pulled out over Rs 2 trillion from Indian equities, according to a report by The Times of India. Several factors have contributed to this trend such as:&gt;Higher capital gains tax rates making Indian investments less appealing.&gt;Weak corporate earnings growth reducing investor confidence.&gt;The falling rupee, which erodes returns when converted back to foreign currencies.&gt;Stronger US markets, where higher bond yields and lower tax burdens offer better returns.&nbsp;Arora had also mentioned that the Indian government had earned $10-11 billion dollars as capital gains tax in 2022-23 (FY23).&nbsp;How does India&rsquo;s capital gains tax compare to other countries?Australia: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable if an asset is held for more than 12 months, taxed at regular personal income tax rates.&nbsp;Canada: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable, rising to two-thirds for gains exceeding CAD 2,50,000 from 24 June 2024.&nbsp;China: No tax on capital gains from shares listed on Chinese stock exchanges. However, a 20 per cent flat tax applies to other capital asset transfers, including securities and real estate.&nbsp;Germany: 25 per cent tax, plus a 5.5 per cent solidarity surcharge and 8-9 per cent church tax, depending on the federal state.&nbsp;United Arab Emirates: No capital gains tax.&nbsp;United Kingdom: Capital gains are taxed at rates of up to 20 per cent (excluding property), up to 24 per cent on residential property, and up to 28 per cent on carried interest gains. The UK also provides an annual tax-free exemption of GBP 3,000.&nbsp;United States: A progressive LTCG tax system, with rates of 0 per cent, 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, depending on taxable income and filing status.

The Bill seeks to update the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948, bringing clarity to resource governance, attracting private investment, and addressing environmental concerns.&nbsp;Key changes introduced in the bill&nbsp;The scope of mineral oils have been broadened by the amendment to include hydrocarbons such as crude oil, natural gas, petroleum, condensate, coal bed methane, shale gas, and oil. However, it explicitly excludes coal, lignite, and helium, likely because these are governed under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.&nbsp;The Bill replaces the term &lsquo;mining leases&rsquo; with &lsquo;petroleum leases&rsquo;, which will now govern exploration, production, and disposal activities. This change aims to streamline environmental and land clearances, which have often caused delays in oil and gas projects. The Bill clarifies that existing mining leases issued under the 1948 Act will remain valid and unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;The violations of the Oilfields Act, 1948, could previously result in imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of \u20b91,000, or both. The new Bill replaces imprisonment with financial penalties, increasing the maximum fine to \u20b925 lakh. If violations continue, an extra fine of up to \u20b910 lakh per day may be imposed. The move shifts the focus from criminal prosecution to financial deterrents for non-compliance.&nbsp;What are the objectives of the bill?&nbsp;The government aims to use this Bill to strengthen domestic oil and gas production, reducing dependence on imports. Currently, India imports over 85 per cent of its crude oil and about 50 per cent of its natural gas, making energy security a critical issue. Further, the Bill seeks to attract private investment into petroleum production while ensuring that the rights of existing leaseholders are not compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater central government control&nbsp;The Bill grants the Central government greater rule-making powers to regulate various aspects of petroleum leases, which included the merging of petroleum leases for operational efficiency, the sharing of infrastructure facilities among leaseholders, and the obligations of lessees to protect the environment and reduce emissions. It also introduces alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, allowing conflicts to be settled either within India or internationally.&nbsp;A new system for handling penalties has been introduced, with an officer of Joint Secretary rank or higher being appointed to adjudicate financial violations. Appeals against their decisions will be directed to the Appellate Tribunal under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) Act, 2006. If further appeals are needed, cases will be heard by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which operates under the Electricity Act, 2003.&nbsp;Potential concerns of the oil regulation bill&nbsp;One of the major concerns is whether the shift from mining leases to petroleum leases could affect states&rsquo; taxation powers under Entry 50 of the State List in the Indian Constitution.&nbsp;The Supreme Court ruling in Mineral Area Development Authority vs Steel Authority of India (2024) reaffirmed that states have exclusive power to tax mining activities. Critics argue that the Bill could lead to disputes over revenue-sharing and jurisdiction between states and the Centre since &lsquo;Entry 53 of the Union List&rsquo; gives the central government control over oilfields.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Bill promoting greater private sector involvement, some critics argue that it may weaken environmental safeguards. The new financial penalties replace imprisonment, which could reduce accountability for environmental violations and safety lapses in oilfields.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Opposition parties have raised concerns that government-owned enterprises like ONGC should be prioritised over private companies for oil exploration and production. There are fears that increased private participation could prioritise profit-making over community welfare and long-term sustainability.&nbsp;What are the Centre&rsquo;s plans?&nbsp;Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri defended the Bill, stating that it is a &lsquo;constructive and positive step&rsquo; toward boosting India&rsquo;s oil and gas production. He highlighted the government&rsquo;s commitment to opening up new exploration areas, including those previously classified as &lsquo;no-go zones&rsquo;.&nbsp;Additionally, the Bill aligns with the government&rsquo;s energy security strategy, particularly after the launch of the 10th Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bidding round on February 11, 2025. The primary focus of the policy is primarily offshore exploration blocks.&nbsp;Puri also noted that India&rsquo;s crude oil demand is expected to rise to 6.5-7 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 5.5 million bpd, emphasising the urgency of strengthening domestic production.", "keywords": ["Oilfields bill", "Oilfields bill upsc", "Oilfields amendment bill", "what is the Oilfields amendment bill", "Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri", "Hardeep Puri", "Lok Sabha", "Oilfield amendment", "Indian oilfields", "private investment in Indian oilfields"], "date": "2025-03-14T07:30:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125031400022", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:45:18"},

Here&rsquo;s a look at the top countries that offer the most promising opportunities for individuals seeking a global advantage.&nbsp; Top Investment Migration Program Options to Access the World&rsquo;s Best Opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;As competition for talent intensifies across the globe, the 2025 Henley Opportunity Index emphasizes the growing importance of investment migration as a strategy for securing a brighter future. With a focus on education, career growth, earning potential, and economic mobility, the report reveals that countries offering structured pathways to residency and citizenship are becoming increasingly sought after by families who view strategic relocation as key to wealth planning and career advancement.&nbsp;&quot;&ldquo;While studies confirm that tertiary graduates earn around 50% more than those with only secondary education, research also reveals that over two-thirds of income disparity worldwide is dictated by the country in which an individual lives and works. With barriers to opportunity often dictated by the limitations of our citizenship, the index makes a compelling case for investment migration as a game-changing strategy for families looking to transcend the constraints of their &lsquo;birthright lottery&rsquo;&quot; said Tess Wilkinson, Director of Henley & Partners Education.&nbsp;The Singapore Global Investor Program is popular among ultra-high-net-worth families, and the city-state is well-established as a world-class education destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, with its EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program offering an efficient route to permanent resident status and new &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; visa proposed, which would offer wealthy investors the right to live and work in the US and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment, is not far behind on 78%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia, which recently launched a new National Innovation Visa, comes in next with 76%, ahead of Canada, which offers a popular Start-Up Visa Program for entrepreneurs and scores 73%, rounding up the Top 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK, which has an Innovator Founder Visa requiring individuals to set up a new, scaling business in the country, secures an opportunity score of 70% when it comes to providing strategic advantage to its citizens and residents, and the UAE, which has numerous categories of beneficiaries for its Golden Residence visa, earns 67%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Austria, which requires a substantial contribution to its economy to secure citizenship, and New Zealand, which recently eased the rules for its Active Investor Plus Visa Program to incentivize investors, each achieve 65%, closely followed by Italy, which also offers an Investor Visa and scores 64% on the Henley Opportunity Index.&nbsp;Further down the list evaluating the possibility of future success is the cosmopolitan wealth hub of Hong Kong, which reintroduced its Capital Investment Entrant Scheme in 2024 and scores 61%, just ahead of rising star Latvia, whose residence by investment offering is one of the fastest and most competitive programs in Europe and scores 60%.&nbsp; Next is Malta, which offers an attractive pathway that allows for the granting of citizenship by a certificate of naturalization to foreign individuals and their families who contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic development, scoring 59%.&nbsp; Hungary, which offers a Guest Investor Residence Permit, follows with an opportunity score of 58%. Greece and Portugal, both scoring 56%, round out the rankings, with Greece&rsquo;s Golden Visa Program shooting up in popularity in the past 12 months, while Portugal&rsquo;s Golden Residence Permit Program has long been favored by investors from across the globe.&nbsp;&quot;By investing in these residence and citizenship programs, families can permanently relocate to regions that offer exceptional educational opportunities, professional development, and high-quality living standards. This significantly enhances earning potential and facilitates wealth creation across generations,&quot; said Wilkinson.&nbsp;&nbsp;She explains this with the following examples:&nbsp;A Vietnamese family with an opportunity score of just 29% in their home country could elevate their next generation&rsquo;s potential success to 78% by securing US residence through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. Similarly, an Indian family with a 37% score could boost their advantage to 84% by relocating to Switzerland via the Swiss Residence Program. In another example, a Nigerian family with a mere 21% opportunity score could dramatically increase their life chances to 79% by obtaining residence through Singapore&rsquo;s Global Investor Program, securing a remarkable advantage. Additionally, investment migration routes such as the UAE&rsquo;s Golden Visa and New Zealand&rsquo;s Active Investor Plus Visa offer next-generation opportunity advantages of 67% and 65%, respectively.&nbsp;&quot;Filipino investors leveraging Canada&rsquo;s Start-Up Visa Program would experience significant improvements in multiple aspects of their lives. Access to premium education would see a rise from a score of 32 out of 100 in the Philippines to 73 in Canada. Earning potential would also grow substantially, improving from 34 to 66. Career advancement opportunities would witness an even greater jump, surging from 35 to 74.

Investors reacted negatively, leading to one of the worst trading days in months.&nbsp;The S&P 500 dropped 155.64 points, a 2.7 per cent decline, closing at 5,614.56&mdash;its lowest level since September and its steepest single-day percentage drop since December. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology stocks, plunged 727.90 points (4 per cent) to close at 17,468.32, its lowest since September.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 890.01 points (2.08 per cent) to 41,911.71, marking its weakest close since early November.&nbsp;Over the weekend, Trump was asked in an interview with Fox News Channel whether he foresaw a recession in 2025. His response, while not a direct confirmation, hinted at economic turbulence ahead.&nbsp;&ldquo;I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we&rsquo;re doing is very big. We&rsquo;re bringing wealth back to America. That&rsquo;s a big thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It takes a little time. It takes a little time.&rdquo;&nbsp;Investors fear that escalating trade tensions could push the US economy into a recession. While market corrections are not uncommon, steep declines like this have historically had multiple causes. Here&rsquo;s a look at past financial crises that shook markets worldwide.&nbsp;Major market crashes in the US&nbsp;The Great Depression (1929)Triggered by the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Great Depression severely impacted the global economy. The DJIA plunged nearly 25 per cent over two days (October 28-29). By mid-1932, the market had declined 89 per cent from its peak. The crash was fuelled by rampant speculation, excessive borrowing, and economic instability, leading to mass unemployment, food shortages, and widespread poverty.&nbsp;Black Monday (October 19, 1987)One of the most dramatic market crashes in history, Black Monday saw the DJIA plunge 22.6 per cent in a single day&mdash;the largest one-day percentage drop ever. Months of rapid stock gains had led to fears of an asset bubble, while a growing trade deficit and a weakening dollar further rattled investor confidence.&nbsp;Dot-com bubble burst (March 2000 - October 2002)The dot-com bubble burst after a period of rapid growth in IT and telecommunications. The rise of the internet led to an explosion of online businesses, attracting heavy investment. However, after peaking in March 2000, the Nasdaq crashed by about 78 per cent by October 2002 due to excessive speculation and failing tech startups.&nbsp;Post-9/11 market reaction (September 2001)Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, US stock markets remained closed for nearly a week. The destruction of the World Trade Center, a key financial hub, caused nearly 3,000 deaths and sent shockwaves through the economy.&nbsp;The airline and insurance industries were hit the hardest. With flights grounded for days, airline stocks saw steep losses. American Airlines and United Airlines, which operated the hijacked flights, suffered massive declines. The insurance industry also faced billions in claims, leading to a liquidity crisis for several firms.&nbsp;Global financial crisis (October 2008)The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a worldwide financial crisis. The Nasdaq, along with other major indices, experienced multiple days of declines exceeding 10 per cent. The crisis was driven by the collapse of major financial institutions, largely due to risky subprime mortgages and frozen credit markets. Banks, including those in the US and Northern Rock in the UK, had adopted a model where they originated and sold mortgages, packaging them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). In 2007, Northern Rock faced a run on deposits, which ended only when the UK government guaranteed them. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, plunging the global financial system into crisis. Government bailouts and stimulus measures were required to stabilise the financial system.&nbsp;Covid-19 market crash (March 2020)The Covid-19 pandemic caused extreme market volatility, with repeated 10 per cent+ drops in March 2020. Lockdowns, economic uncertainty, and investor panic led to trading halts.&nbsp;Major global market crashes&nbsp;2015 Chinese stock market crashBetween June 2014 and June 2015, China&rsquo;s Shanghai Composite Index surged 150 per cent, fuelled by speculative trading. By mid-2015, the bubble burst, causing a 32 per cent drop in a month and an overall 40 per cent decline.&nbsp;2022 Russian stock market crashFollowing Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) index fell 43.58 per cent in just four trading days in February 2022. Western sanctions and economic uncertainty fuelled panic selling, prompting Russia&rsquo;s central bank to halt trading temporarily.&nbsp;Major stock market crashes in India&nbsp;1865 cotton boom and bustOne of India&rsquo;s earliest market crashes was in May 1865, a decade before the Bombay Stock Exchange was incorporated. It was caused by excessive speculation in cotton exports during the American Civil War. When the war ended, cotton prices collapsed, triggering a severe market crash. Mumbai&rsquo;s economy suffered, and its population declined by 21 per cent over the next few years.&nbsp;1982 Reliance short-selling crisisA bear cartel attempted to crash Reliance Industries&rsquo; stock by offloading shares, driving prices down. In a few days, Reliance&rsquo;s share price dropped sharply. However, a counter-group known as the &ldquo;Friends of Reliance&rdquo; bought up shares, reversing the trend and stabilising the market.&nbsp;1992 Harshad Mehta scamStockbroker Harshad Mehta manipulated stock prices using fraudulent bank funds, inflating the BSE Sensex from 1,000 to over 4,500 points. When the scam was exposed, the market crashed by nearly 2,000 points, wiping out \u20b91 trillion in investor wealth.&nbsp;2008 global financial crisis impact on IndiaThe 2008 crisis led to foreign investors pulling out of Indian markets.
