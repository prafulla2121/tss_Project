What is it and how it affect state functions", "content": "Biren Singh on Sunday stepped down as the Chief Minister of Manipur, a state grappling with ongoing ethnic violence. He submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at the Raj Bhavan. This decision followed escalating tensions and persistent unrest in the northeastern state, which had already claimed hundreds of lives over the past two years.&nbsp;Singh had assumed office as the Chief Minister of Manipur for the first time in 2017.&nbsp;What did Biren Singh&rsquo;s resignation say?&nbsp;In his resignation letter, Biren Singh expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve the people of Manipur and thanked the central government for its timely interventions. &ldquo;It has been an honour to serve the people of Manipur thus far. I am extremely grateful to the central government for timely actions, interventions, developmental work and implementation of various projects for safeguarding the interest of every single Manipuri,&rdquo; he said in his resignation letter.&nbsp;Was Biren Singh losing support among MLAs?News agency PTI reported that Biren Singh had been losing support among BJP MLAs, with several of them meeting party leaders in Delhi to voice their concerns. Despite this, BJP Manipur President A Sharda Devi denied any discord, stating that Biren&#39;s resignation was for the state&#39;s future. She said that his resignation was motivated by a desire for peace and that he had called for the Centre&rsquo;s continued support to ensure the safety of the people.&nbsp;Opposition calls for no-confidence motionOpposition parties had been demanding Singh&rsquo;s resignation for his failure to address the ongoing violence. Following Singh&rsquo;s resignation, Congress&rsquo;s Manipur President Keisham Meghachandra announced plans to move a no-confidence motion in the state Assembly.&nbsp;The Opposition also called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Manipur to assess the situation. This demand was echoed by Trinamool Congress leader Derek O&rsquo;Brien, who criticised the PM&rsquo;s speech in Parliament for omitting key issues, including the violence in Manipur.&nbsp;Manipur ethnic clashesManipur has been witnessing violent clashes between the valley-based Meitei community and the Kuki-Zo groups. The violence, which began in May 2023, has led to the deaths of over 250 people and displaced thousands. The conflict was sparked by a demand from the Meitei community for Scheduled Tribe status, leading to protests and clashes.&nbsp;Social media videos from the region showed the devastating effects of the violence, including burned homes and disturbing images of sexual harassment. Prominent figures, including boxer MC Mary Kom, have called for peace and security in the state.&nbsp;Biren Singh&rsquo;s role in the ethnic violenceThe controversy surrounding Singh deepened when the Supreme Court sought a forensic report regarding leaked audio clips. These clips allegedly contained conversations suggesting that Singh had allowed Meitei groups to loot arms during the unrest.&nbsp;The Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHUR) called for a court-monitored investigation into the allegations, claiming that Singh played a central role in organising and inciting violence against Kuki-dominated areas.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s next for Manipur state?With Singh&rsquo;s resignation, speculation has risen about the possibility of President&rsquo;s Rule in the state. While the governor has accepted Singh&rsquo;s resignation, he has asked him to continue in office until a successor is appointed.&nbsp;The ruling BJP is expected to hold meetings to finalise a new Chief Minister. The Manipur Assembly&#39;s Budget session, scheduled to begin on February 10, has been suspended until a new leader is in place.&nbsp;President&rsquo;s Rule in Manipur?The imposition of President&rsquo;s Rule in Manipur could be considered under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, which allows the President to take action when a state government fails to comply with constitutional provisions. The decision would follow advice from the Union Council of Ministers.&nbsp;The Article 356 reads, &ldquo;Where any State has failed to comply with, or to give effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.&rdquo;&nbsp;Several conditions must be met before the President can impose President&#39;s Rule in a state. These include:&nbsp; 1. The President must be convinced that the governance of the state can no longer be carried out in accordance with the Constitution.2. The state government fails to elect a new chief minister within the time frame set by the state&rsquo;s governor.3. A coalition breakdown occurs, resulting in the chief minister losing majority support in the legislature, and the CM is unable to prove majority within the prescribed period.4. The assembly loses its majority due to a no-confidence vote.5. Elections are delayed due to extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters, war, or an epidemic.&nbsp;What will happen once President&rsquo;s Rule is imposed?Once President&rsquo;s Rule is imposed, the governor assumes the administration of the state on behalf of the President, working with the Chief Secretary and other appointed advisors or administrators. The President can also declare that the powers of the state legislature will be exercised by Parliament.&nbsp;Under this rule, the state legislative assembly may either be suspended or dissolved. Additionally, when Parliament is not in session, the President has the authority to issue ordinances related to the state&#39;s administration.&nbsp;When is the President&rsquo;s Rule revoked?President&rsquo;s Rule can be revoked at any time through a subsequent proclamation by the President. This revocation does not require approval from Parliament. It typically happens when a political party leader presents evidence of majority support in the assembly and claims the right to form the state government.", "keywords": ["Biren Singh", "Biren Singh resignation", "no-confidence motion", "Manipur", "Manipur president's rule", "manipur violence", "what is president's rule", "president's rule in manipur", "when is president's rule imposed", "Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla", "maniour ethnic violence", "manipur CM resignation", "manipur political crisis", "Manipur news", "Meitei", "Kuki-Zo", "ethnic clashes", "manipur no-confidence motion"], "date": "2025-02-10T13:39:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021000565", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:52:41"},

This mandate, announced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will be enforced at security checkpoints in airports nationwide.&nbsp;What is a REAL ID?&nbsp;REAL ID is a federal compliant driver&#39;s licence, learner permit, or non-driver ID issued by state departments of motor vehicles (DMVs). It features enhanced security measures designed to reduce identity fraud and improve national security, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The most distinctive feature of a REAL ID is a star emblem located in the upper right corner, which indicates compliance with federal standards.&nbsp;Why is REAL ID Required?&nbsp;The REAL ID Act was enacted in 2005 to enhance security measures following the events of September 11, 2001. By setting stricter standards for state-issued IDs, the government aims to ensure that all identification used for federal purposes meets specific identity verification requirements. This includes boarding domestic flights, entering federal facilities, and accessing military bases.&nbsp;How to Get a REAL ID?&nbsp;To obtain a REAL ID, you must visit your local DMV or Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) office. The application process typically requires in-person attendance, and you will need to provide specific documents.&nbsp;Proof of identity: This can include a US birth certificate, valid US passport, or other approved documents.&nbsp;Proof of social security number: A social security card or W-2 form is usually required.&nbsp;Proof of residency: You may need to provide multiple documents showing your current address, such as utility bills or lease agreements.&nbsp;Costs Associated with REAL ID&nbsp;In most states, obtaining a REAL ID does not incur additional costs beyond standard DMV fees for driver&#39;s licences or ID cards.

The person writing the essay described themselves as part of a secret resistance to counter Trump&#39;s misguided impulses, and its publication touched off a leak investigation in Trump&#39;s first White House.Taylor later published a book under the pen name Anonymous and publicly revealed his identity days before the 2020 election.Trump said Wednesday that Taylor was like a traitor and that his writings about confidential meetings were like spying.I think he&#39;s guilty of treason,&quot; he said.Taylor responded by saying Trump had proved his point.Dissent isn&#39;t unlawful. It certainly isn&#39;t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path,&quot; he wrote on X.Trump named Krebs the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency but became angered with him after he declared the 2020 election that Trump lost to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.Krebs did not respond to a message seeking comment, but late Wednesday he shared on X a message he originally posted when he left government in 2020: Honored to serve. We did it right.Trump has falsely claimed he was cheated out of reelection in 2020 by widespread fraud, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states where he disputed his loss all affirmed Biden&#39;s victory. Judges, including some he appointed, rejected dozens of his legal challenges.It&#39;s bizarre to see a president investigate his own administration and his own appointee, said David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer and coauthor of The Big Truth, a book about Trump&#39;s 2020 election lies.Becker noted that Krebs issued his reassurances about the security of the upcoming election for months during 2020 without pushback from the then-president, with Trump only souring on him after the votes were counted.The reason he can sit in the White House today and govern from that position is because our election system is secure and has accurately determined who has won the presidency, Becker said.Susman Godfrey, the firm Trump targeted in an order Wednesday, represented Dominion Voting Systems in a lawsuit that accused Fox News of falsely claiming that the voting company had rigged the 2020 presidential election. Fox News ultimately agreed to pay nearly $800 million to avert a trial.The order bars the firm from using government resources or buildings, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf.In a statement, Susman Godfrey responded that people who know the firm know it takes seriously its duty to uphold the rule of law. This principle guides us now, the firm said. &quot;There is no question that we will fight this unconstitutional order.Trump has issued a series of orders meant to punish firms, including by ordering the suspension of lawyers&#39; security clearances and revoking federal contracts.

This marked the first such deportation flight under US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration. As the migrants landed back in India, many shared harrowing details of their journey through the &lsquo;dunki&rsquo; route, a dangerous and illegal method of crossing borders.&nbsp;Among the 104 deported Indians, there were 33 from Haryana, 33 from Gujarat, 30 from Punjab, three from Maharashtra, three from Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh. The group also included 19 women and 13 minors, with the youngest being a four-year-old boy.&nbsp;Many deportees remained unaware they were being sent back to India until just before departure. Speaking to news agency PTI, Singh, from Hardorwal village in Gurdaspur, recounted being handcuffed and shackled throughout the flight. Restraints were only removed upon arrival in Amritsar.&nbsp;Jaspal, another deportee, said he had paid Rs 30 lakh to an agent who assured him legal entry into the US. Instead, he found himself stranded in Brazil for six months before making the treacherous overland journey to the US, only to be arrested by Border Patrol and held in detention for 11 days.&nbsp;Harwinder Singh, from Hoshiarpur, described 15-hour boat rides, crossing 40-45 km on foot, and surviving near-drownings.&nbsp;The mass deportation signals the Trump administration&rsquo;s intensified crackdown on illegal immigration, particularly through the high-risk &lsquo;donkey route&rsquo; that many Indians continue to take in pursuit of the American dream. Here is a closer look at dunki and understanding what it entails.&nbsp;What is the &lsquo;dunki&rsquo; route?The term &lsquo;dunki&rsquo;, derived from the Punjabi idiom meaning &lsquo;to hop from place to place&rsquo;, refers to an illegal immigration technique known as &lsquo;donkey flights&rsquo;.&nbsp;This method involves crossing borders through a series of covert stops in multiple countries, often facilitated by agents who charge exorbitant fees. These agents may offer a range of services, from providing fake documents to smuggling individuals through ship containers or hidden compartments in vehicles.&nbsp;The process typically begins with migrants obtaining a tourist visa for European Union Schengen countries, allowing them to move freely across 26 nations. Once in the EU, consultants help them illegally enter countries like the UK or the US using forged documents or by hiding in vehicles.&nbsp;While the dunki method can be used to enter any country, the US, Canada, and the UK remain the most sought-after destinations for Indian migrants.&nbsp;Why risk the dunki route?Post-independence, many Indian families who migrated to developed nations found better social, economic, and political conditions, creating a lasting aspiration for others to follow suit. This trend has only intensified over the years, with both legal and illegal migration on the rise.&nbsp;The allure of a better life drives many to take these risks. The promise of higher incomes, greater opportunities, and an improved standard of living, often encapsulated in the idea of the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo;, fuels the desire to migrate. For many, this dream is worth the dangers and financial sacrifices.In other cases, migrants may be &ldquo;cheated&rdquo; by agents into crossing borders illegally after paying high fees.&nbsp;Some sell ancestral land or other assets to pay agents, only to find themselves exploited further. Agents often withhold passports or demand additional payments, leaving migrants vulnerable and trapped.&nbsp;The dunki route, what it entails, reason why people may embark on it, and what they may find after entering a foreign country was detailed in Raj Kumar Hirani&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dunki&rsquo;, a 2023 Bollywood film starring Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, and Boman Irani.&nbsp;Indians fifth-largest group of US illegal migrantsAccording to the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), Indians are the fifth-largest group of illegal migrants entering the US via its southwest border. Between October 2022 and September 2023, nearly 97,000 Indians were caught attempting to cross illegally, with over 30,000 detained at the Canada border and 41,770 at the Mexico border. The majority of these migrants hail from Punjab and Gujarat, states with a long history of migration to Western countries.&nbsp;Risks of illegal migrationThe &lsquo;dunki route&rsquo; is fraught with dangers. Migrants face the risk of capture, imprisonment, and deportation, as was the case in the US. The journey itself is perilous, with harsh weather conditions, rugged terrains, and limited access to food and water.&nbsp;Many also fall victim to exploitation, with agents extorting money or abandoning them mid-journey. While migrant smuggling is distinct from human trafficking, the two crimes can intersect, further endangering those involved. Recent deportation flights also show that these perilous journeys can sometimes amount to nothing.", "keywords": ["dunki", "dunki route", "what is dunki route", "why people choose dunki route", "dunki route agents", "illegal immigrations", "border crossing"], "date": "2025-02-06T11:16:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020600326", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:52:43"},

This change is expected to impact thousands of non-immigrant visa holders, including those on H-1B, F-1, and B1/B2 visas.&nbsp;While the US embassy in India has not confirmed the change, Atlys, an online visa processing platform, said it updated its eligibility criteria in the past week.&nbsp;&quot;Although there hasn&#39;t been any official announcement, the change is now being enforced and applications that have expired for more than 12 months are no longer accepted,&quot; an Atlys spokesperson told Business Standard.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s changed?&nbsp;Previously, individuals could renew their visas using the dropbox system if their previous visa had expired within the past 48 months. This extended policy was introduced during the pandemic to ease consular backlogs. The latest change means many applicants will now have to appear for in-person interviews, which could further strain the visa system.&nbsp;According to The National Law Review, this shift will likely cause delays and travel disruptions for non-immigrant visa holders, including those on:&nbsp;H-1B &ndash; a work visa for skilled professionals in specialised fields, requiring a job offer from a US employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;F-1 &ndash; a student visa for academic programmes in the US, allowing limited on-campus employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;B1/B2 &ndash; a short-term visa for business (B1) or tourism (B2), which does not permit employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;L-1 &ndash; a visa for employees transferring within a multinational company to a US office, applicable to executives, managers, or specialised knowledge workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;O-1 &ndash; a visa for individuals with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed?&nbsp;Applicants now qualify for the dropbox process only if their visa expired within the past 12 months and is in the same category. Those who do not meet this requirement must schedule an in-person interview, which may lead to:&nbsp;&lt; Increased demand for in-person appointments at US consulates&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Longer wait times for visa interviews, particularly in high-volume cities&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Possible disruptions for business travellers and professionals requiring swift renewals&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; The change is also expected to impact Indian students in the US.&nbsp;Siddharth Iyer, chief operating officer at OneStep Global, told Business Standard, &quot;The recent policy shift in the US visa renewal process for students (F-1) represents a significant adjustment, particularly for applicants in India. With the eligibility for interview waivers now reduced to 12 months from the previous 48 months, some students may experience longer wait times and additional steps when renewing their visas. While this adjustment reflects a return to pre-pandemic regulations, it comes at a time when demand for international education is high.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;This change aims to streamline the process, but it could pose challenges for students who fall outside the updated eligibility window. However, it&#39;s important to note that many students will still have ample opportunities to renew their visas through the regular process,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who are affected by this change should stay informed, plan their renewals well in advance, and continue to reach out to their university&rsquo;s international offices or visa consultants for guidance.&quot;&nbsp;Visa appointment delays in India&nbsp;Getting a visa appointment in India is already a lengthy process. The wait time for a B1/B2 (business and tourism) visa interview in 2022 exceeded 999 days.

Its annual report indicates a loss of Rs 22.78 crore for the financial year ending March 2024, following a previous year&rsquo;s loss of Rs 30.75 crore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the RBI directive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective from the close of business on February 13, 2025, the bank is restricted from:&nbsp;&nbsp;-Issuing or renewing loans and advances&nbsp;&nbsp;-Making fresh investments&nbsp;&nbsp;-Borrowing funds or accepting new deposits&nbsp;&nbsp;-Disbursing payments to meet liabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;-Selling, transferring, or disposing of assets without prior RBI approval&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, depositors will be unable to withdraw funds from their accounts due to the bank&rsquo;s liquidity crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer concerns and reactionsThe announcement has triggered anxiety among account holders, many of whom depend on the bank for routine financial transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 14, several customers gathered outside the bank&rsquo;s branches in Mumbai, demanding clarity on the situation and access to their funds. Many expressed distress over financial obligations such as loan repayments, rent, and daily expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One customer, Seema Waghmare, told news agency ANI, &ldquo;We deposited money just yesterday, but they did not say anything. They should have told us that this was going to happen. Now they are saying we&rsquo;ll get our money within three months. We have EMIs to pay, and no idea how we&rsquo;ll manage that.&rdquo;&nbsp;Will depositors get their money?&nbsp;&nbsp;The RBI has clarified that while the bank faces financial stress, its licence remains intact, meaning it can still operate under restrictions. The central bank will continue monitoring the situation and decide further action accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under RBI regulations, eligible depositors can receive up to Rs 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) if a claim is made, providing some relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permitted transactions despite restrictionsDespite the imposed limitations, the RBI has allowed the bank to:&nbsp;&nbsp;-Adjust depositors&rsquo; funds against existing loans, subject to conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;-Pay necessary expenses such as employee salaries, rent, and utility bills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any new loans, advances, or investments will require prior RBI approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictions will remain in place for six months, during which the RBI will evaluate the bank&rsquo;s financial health and determine the next steps.

Trump claims that many countries have higher tariffs on US imports than the United States does on theirs, creating an uneven playing field that disadvantages US manufacturing.&nbsp;Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump made a campaign promise stating: &ldquo;An eye for an eye, a tariff for a tariff, same exact amount.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Every country will be reciprocal,&rdquo; Trump remarked on Sunday.&nbsp;This idea is not new; during his first term, Trump&#39;s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, suggested increasing tariffs to align with the import taxes of other nations, with plans to reduce them only once those countries did the same.Trump&rsquo;s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, stated that the proposals could be finalised by early April.However, this approach carries potential risks. Heavier tariffs on imports could lead to increased inflation in the US, the world&rsquo;s largest economy, while also slowing down economic growth in other nations.&nbsp;How will the tariffs be structured?Trump&rsquo;s reciprocal tariffs will be tailored to each trading partner, as reported by Bloomberg, referencing a White House memo. These tariffs aim to address perceived unfair trade practices, including excessive regulations, value-added taxes (VAT), exchange rate manipulation, and inadequate intellectual property protection.&nbsp;The tariffs could be applied in several forms, such as targeting specific products, entire industries, or a general tariff on all goods from a particular country. In some cases, the US might reduce tariffs in response to positive actions from other countries, though this remains uncertain.&nbsp;How did India respond to Trump&rsquo;s tariff call?Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to initiate discussions on trade and tariff-related matters, as confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.&nbsp;During a press briefing following a meeting between PM Modi and Trump at the White House, Misri said, &ldquo;We have indicated, and the two leaders have agreed today to start discussing trade and tariff-related issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;He further added, &ldquo;So, I will let those discussions begin before commenting on what may unfold with regard to the plans announced today by the US administration.&rdquo;&nbsp;Before he met with PM Modi, Trump declared reciprocal tariffs on countries, including India. &ldquo;On trade, I have decided that for fairness, I&rsquo;ll charge reciprocal tariffs &mdash; meaning, whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them &mdash; no more, no less. They charge us with tax and tariffs, it&rsquo;s very simple we will charge them with exact tax and tariffs,&rdquo; Trump explained.&nbsp;Which countries would be most affected by the tariffs?Emerging markets like India, Argentina, and many nations in Africa and Southeast Asia are expected to be hit hardest by these tariffs, according to the report.

Industry executives argue that the deadline is impractical,&nbsp;highlighting challenges such as recycling infrastructure, material shortages, and cost concerns, especially with peak summer demand approaching, according to a report by&nbsp;The Economic Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverage giants including Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co, Bisleri, and Parle Agro are all impacted by these stringent deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued this directive over two years ago as part of India&rsquo;s Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules. However, beverage companies contend that the industry is not adequately prepared for the transition, despite the extended timeline.&nbsp;PET vs rPET bottlesPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, and rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) are both widely used in packaging and textiles, but they differ significantly in their environmental impact and production process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PET is a durable, lightweight plastic commonly found in beverage bottles, food containers, and synthetic fibres. Its strength and recyclability make it a popular choice, but it is primarily produced from fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, making its manufacturing process resource-intensive and environmentally demanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, rPET is an eco-friendlier alternative derived from recycled PET products. Post-consumer PET waste, such as plastic bottles, is collected, cleaned, and processed into flakes, which are then melted and repurposed into rPET pellets or resin. These materials are used to create new products like rPET packaging, rPET sheets, and rPET polyester fabrics, reducing reliance on virgin plastics and minimising waste.&nbsp;What is the govt mandate on PET bottles?To incentivise domestic recycling, India banned the import of plastic waste, including PET bottles in 2015. By 2016, however, the ban was amended, allowing plastic waste imports only for units located in special economic zones (SEZs).&nbsp;The Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 banned plastic sachets used for gutkha, tobacco, and pan masala due to high littering potential. Additionally, states/UTs were asked to form special task forces for eliminating single-use plastics (SUPs).&nbsp;Plastic packaging producers, e-commerce firms, and major SUPs users were directed to phase out SUPs. Compliance varied by state/UT, with some implementing partial bans while others enforced a complete ban.&nbsp;In 2019, the Environment Ministry imposed a full ban on plastic waste imports to strengthen India&rsquo;s waste management system and prevent the country from becoming a dumping ground. The Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Smriti Manch (PDUSM) campaign played a role in advocating for this decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;India allows PET waste imports&nbsp;The ban on PET bottle imports was lifted in 2021 after industries processing plastic waste reported shortages in India. Seven Indian companies applied to import 93,000 tonnes of PET bottle waste from the US, Canada, and Germany, citing insufficient domestic supply.&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change mandates that beverage makers use 30 per cent recycled plastic in rigid packaging, like PET bottles, starting April 1, 2025 with annual increases of 10 per cent to reach 60 per cent by financial year 2027-28 to 2028-29.&nbsp;Industry urges govt to adopt &lsquo;realistic targets&rsquo;Industry representatives, during a December meeting with the Central Pollution Control Board, argued that the 30 per cent threshold is too stringent due to the scarcity of rPET and urged the government to adopt more realistic targets, suggesting an initial 15 per cent obligation with gradual 5 per cent annual increases, the Hindu Bussinessline had earlier reported.&nbsp;Industry leaders say that despite ongoing investments, recycling capacity expansion takes 2-3 years. At present, only five Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)-approved plants are equipped to produce food-grade rPET, meeting just 15 per cent of industry demand.&nbsp;Affordability and regulatory concernsThe industry fears that bottling costs will surge by nearly 30 per cent, a portion of which may be passed on to consumers. Smaller companies, lacking resources to procure certified rPET, may resort to lower-quality recyclers, raising safety and regulatory concerns.&nbsp;Another challenge is that plastic bottles account for 70 per cent of beverage packaging, making them the most widely used option due to lower transport costs compared to glass and affordability over aluminium cans. The sudden shift to higher rPET content without sufficient infrastructure could disrupt supply chains.&nbsp;Govt response and legal issuesCiting officials, The Economic Times reported that the government is unlikely to extend the deadline, citing that companies have had sufficient time to comply. Industry executives, however, believe the rigid timeline could force them to seek an anticipatory stay in court, delaying implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["beverage giants", "india rpet bottle mandate", "rpet deadline April 2025", "Beverage companies PET bottles", "Indian beverage companies recycled PET bottles", "Indian government recycled PET bottles"], "date": "2025-02-26T11:36:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022600258", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:23"},

The latest row erupted after the Centre withheld Rs 2,150 crore meant for Tamil Nadu after the MK Stalin-led government refused to implement the NEP in the state.&nbsp;According to Chief Minister MK Stalin, the opposition to the NEP was not merely due to the &quot;attempt to impose Hindi&quot; but also because of factors that would have serious consequences for the future of students and the social justice system.&nbsp;Here&#39;s explaining why Tamil Nadu is opposed to NEP:&nbsp;Core concerns&nbsp;1. Three-language formula: The NEP 2020 recommends a three-language formula, suggesting that students learn three languages, with at least two being native to India. Tamil Nadu has historically adhered to a two-language policy, teaching only Tamil and English in schools. The state perceives the introduction of a third language as an attempt to impose Hindi, which has been a sensitive issue since the anti-Hindi agitations of the 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK have expressed strong reservations against this aspect of the NEP, emphasising the importance of preserving Tamil linguistic heritage and opposing any form of Hindi imposition.&nbsp;2. Centralisation and state autonomy: Tamil Nadu argues that the NEP&#39;s framework undermines the state&#39;s autonomy over its educational policies. Education in India is a concurrent subject, allowing both the state and central governments to legislate on it. The state contends that the NEP imposes a uniform national policy that doesn&#39;t account for regional socio-economic and cultural differences, thereby infringing upon the state&#39;s rights to tailor education to its unique context.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Four-year undergraduate programme: The NEP proposes restructuring undergraduate programmes into a four-year course with multiple exit options, allowing students to leave with a certificate after one year, a diploma after two years, or a degree after completing the full program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics in Tamil Nadu fear that this structure may lead to increased dropout rates, as students might opt for early exit points, thereby affecting the quality and depth of higher education. Also, there are concerns about the state&#39;s readiness in terms of infrastructure and faculty to implement such a system effectively.&nbsp;4. Common entrance exams: Tamil Nadu strongly opposes the entrance exam policies under NEP 2020, particularly CUET and NEET, arguing that they disadvantage state-board students and undermine social justice. The state rejects CUET for university admissions, claiming it favours CBSE students and increases reliance on coaching centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Centre withhold funds for Tamil Nadu?&nbsp;The Centre&#39;s decision to link the release of funds under schemes like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to the implementation of the NEP has intensified the controversy. Tamil Nadu alleges that over Rs 2,150 crore in SSA funds have been withheld because of its refusal to adopt the NEP and the three-language policy.&nbsp;According to MK Stalin, the implementation of NEP will push Tamil Nadu back by 2000 years. &quot;The Centre says Tamil Nadu will get Rs 2,000 crore if the state implements the NEP. I wish to say that we will not agree to the NEP even if the Centre offers Rs 10,000 crore. I will not allow the NEP and commit the sin of pushing Tamil Nadu backward by 2,000 years,&quot; Stalin said.&nbsp;Stalin also wrote to PM Modi, asking him to help release Rs 2,152 crore in Samagra Shiksha funds for the state. He requested that the funds not be linked to the implementation of NEP 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Centre&#39;s stand?&nbsp;Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called out the DMK government&#39;s stand, saying that Stalin&rsquo;s letter to the PM goes against the idea of cooperative federalism.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tamil Nadu has always been a torchbearer of social and educational progress, pioneering some of the most transformative reforms in India. However, the continued opposition to the NEP 2020 for political reasons deprives students, teachers, and educational institutions in Tamil Nadu of the immense opportunities and resources that this policy offers. The policy is designed to be flexible, allowing states to customise its implementation to suit their unique educational needs,&rdquo; Pradhan wrote in response.", "keywords": ["tamil nadu new education policy", "tamil nadu nep", "tamil nadu nep opposition stalin", "tamil nadu nep rejection", "why tamil nadu oppose nep", "mk stalin nep", "tamil nadu hindi imposition", "dravidian politics"], "date": "2025-02-23T16:04:51+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022300382", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:23"},

Arora, founder and chief investment officer of Helios Capital, voiced his concerns at the Business Standard Manthan Summit 2025, arguing that the tax policy is discouraging foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and driving them away from Indian markets.&nbsp;But why is it causing investor concerns? To grasp the issue, it&rsquo;s important to understand what capital gains tax is and how it works.&nbsp;What is capital gains tax?When individuals or entities sell certain capital assets &ndash; such as stocks, mutual funds, property, gold, or other investments &ndash; they make a capital gain (profit) on the sale. If these assets were held for over a year, the profit is classified as a long-term capital gain and is taxed accordingly.&nbsp;What are the types of capital gains tax?Capital gains tax is categorised into short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG), depending on the holding period of the asset.&nbsp;Short-term capital gains (STCG): This tax applies when an asset is sold within a short duration after purchase. It is generally taxed at a higher rate.&nbsp;Long-term capital gains (LTCG): This tax applies when an asset is held for an extended period before being sold. It is typically taxed at a lower rate to encourage long-term investment.&nbsp;What is the STCG in India?STCG apply when assets like stocks, mutual funds, real estate, or other capital assets are sold within a short holding period &mdash; typically less than one year for equities and less than two years for real estate.&nbsp;In India, STCG on equity-oriented investments (where Securities Transaction Tax is paid) is taxed at 15 per cent, while STCG from other assets is taxed as per the investor&rsquo;s income tax slab rate.&nbsp;How to calculate STCG?Short-term capital gains (STCG) are calculated by subtracting the cost of acquisition, cost of improvement (if any), and any expenses related to the sale from the selling price of the asset. The formula is:STCG = Sale Price &ndash; (Purchase Price + Improvement Cost + Transfer Expenses)&nbsp;What is the LTCG in India?In India, LTCG on stocks and equity-oriented mutual funds is taxed at 12.5 per cent (plus surcharge and cess) for profits exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per year. However, LTCG was not applicable on equity until 2018 for gains up to Rs 1 lakh.&nbsp;The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced a major shift in capital gains taxation, increasing the LTCG tax rate to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent and eliminating the indexation benefit that previously allowed investors to adjust the purchase price of assets for inflation.&nbsp;Last year&rsquo;s Budget also called for equal tax treatment for foreign and domestic investors. There are no changes to the taxation of long-term capital gains (LTCG) derived from residential property in the new Income Tax Bill 2025.&nbsp;How to calculate LTCGThe taxable amount under LTCG is determined by subtracting the cost of acquisition from the sale price, and in the case of property or other high-value assets, certain transaction costs like brokerage or legal fees can be deducted before applying the tax.&nbsp;Why are investors worried?The elimination of indexation benefits has been particularly controversial. Previously, indexation allowed taxpayers to adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, effectively reducing taxable gains. By removing this benefit, the new tax structure could increase the tax burden on investors, especially those selling property, gold, and unlisted assets.&nbsp;Foreign investors, in particular, have been hit hard by these changes. Speaking at the Business Standard annual summit Arora of Helios Capital argued that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) &ndash; which form a significant portion of foreign investment &ndash; are now disincentivised from investing in India.&nbsp;&ldquo;The biggest mistake they (the government) have made, the biggest souring of sentiment, and reality which they have to accept is capital gains tax in India, particularly the foreign investors, is 100 per cent wrong,&rdquo; Arora said. &ldquo;The largest investors in the world and in India are foreign sovereign funds, pension funds, universities, and the HNIs. Taxing them on their gains, especially when they have no tax set-off available in their home country and when they face forex-related risks, is a big mistake that the government is making.&rdquo;&nbsp;How has this impacted the Indian market?Since October 2024, foreign investors have pulled out over Rs 2 trillion from Indian equities, according to a report by The Times of India. Several factors have contributed to this trend such as:&gt;Higher capital gains tax rates making Indian investments less appealing.&gt;Weak corporate earnings growth reducing investor confidence.&gt;The falling rupee, which erodes returns when converted back to foreign currencies.&gt;Stronger US markets, where higher bond yields and lower tax burdens offer better returns.&nbsp;Arora had also mentioned that the Indian government had earned $10-11 billion dollars as capital gains tax in 2022-23 (FY23).&nbsp;How does India&rsquo;s capital gains tax compare to other countries?Australia: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable if an asset is held for more than 12 months, taxed at regular personal income tax rates.&nbsp;Canada: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable, rising to two-thirds for gains exceeding CAD 2,50,000 from 24 June 2024.&nbsp;China: No tax on capital gains from shares listed on Chinese stock exchanges. However, a 20 per cent flat tax applies to other capital asset transfers, including securities and real estate.&nbsp;Germany: 25 per cent tax, plus a 5.5 per cent solidarity surcharge and 8-9 per cent church tax, depending on the federal state.&nbsp;United Arab Emirates: No capital gains tax.&nbsp;United Kingdom: Capital gains are taxed at rates of up to 20 per cent (excluding property), up to 24 per cent on residential property, and up to 28 per cent on carried interest gains. The UK also provides an annual tax-free exemption of GBP 3,000.&nbsp;United States: A progressive LTCG tax system, with rates of 0 per cent, 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, depending on taxable income and filing status.

To understand this, we need to first understand what delimitation is, how it works, and why it has become a contentious issue.&nbsp;What is delimitation?&nbsp;Delimitation is the process of redrawing the boundaries of parliamentary and state assembly constituencies to reflect demographic changes. It ensures that electoral representation aligns with population shifts and determines how many seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), reported India Today.&nbsp;The principle behind delimitation is to maintain equitable representation, preventing densely populated regions from being underrepresented while ensuring sparsely populated areas are not overrepresented. The core philosophy is the democratic ideal of &ldquo;one person, one vote, one value.&rdquo;&nbsp;Why and how is delimitation done?&nbsp;The process of delimitation is mandated by Articles 82 and 170 of the Indian Constitution, which require the number of parliamentary and assembly seats to be revised based on the most recent census. The task is executed by the Delimitation Commission, a body established through a law passed by Parliament.&nbsp;However, delimitation is not merely a mechanical exercise of redrawing maps&mdash;it has deep political implications. Since seats are allocated based on population, states with higher population growth could gain more seats, while those with lower population growth could see their representation shrink.&nbsp;History of delimitation in India&nbsp;India has conducted delimitation exercises three times&mdash;in 1951, 1961, and 1971&mdash;before freezing the process to encourage population control.&nbsp;Growth of Lok Sabha seats over timeCensus year&nbsp;Lok Sabha seatsPopulation1951&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;494361 million&nbsp;1961&nbsp;&nbsp;522&nbsp;439 million1971&nbsp;543548 million&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, the government, amid an aggressive family planning campaign, froze delimitation for 25 years through the 42nd Amendment Act to prevent states with higher population growth from gaining an unfair advantage. This freeze was extended again in 2001 by the 84th Amendment Act, postponing delimitation until 2026.&nbsp;Today, the 543 Lok Sabha seats and 250 Rajya Sabha seats remain based on 1971 census figures, even though constituency boundaries and SC/ST reservations were adjusted in 2001.&nbsp;The upcoming delimitation and its potential impact&nbsp;The 2031 Census will likely guide the next delimitation exercise, redrawing boundaries and altering the number of parliamentary seats allocated to states. However, with the 2021 Census delayed, discussions on delimitation have already begun in anticipation of the 2026 deadline.&nbsp;How could delimitation change representation?&nbsp;Delimitation can result in increased, decreased, or adjusted constituencies without necessarily changing the total number of parliamentary seats. However, projections suggest that if the current population trends are followed, the number of Lok Sabha seats may increase from 543 to 753.&nbsp;Current representation of Southern states&nbsp;Currently, southern states hold 129 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats:&nbsp;Telangana: 17 seatsAndhra Pradesh: 25 seatsKerala: 20 seatsTamil Nadu: 39 seatsKarnataka: 28 seats&nbsp;This accounts for 24 per cent of Lok Sabha representation.&nbsp;Projected representation after delimitation&nbsp;If the total number of Lok Sabha seats increases to 753, the South&rsquo;s share could drop to 19 per cent.&nbsp;Telangana: 20 seatsAndhra Pradesh: 28 seatsKerala: 19 seatsTamil Nadu: 41 seatsKarnataka: 36 seats&nbsp;In contrast, northern states&mdash;especially Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan&mdash;are expected to gain significant seats:&nbsp;Uttar Pradesh: From 80 to 128 seatsBihar: From 40 to 70 seatsMadhya Pradesh: From 29 to 47 seatsMaharashtra: From 48 to 68 seatsRajasthan: From 25 to 44 seats&nbsp;This shift is at the heart of the southern states&rsquo; concerns.&nbsp;Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s stance on delimitation&nbsp;Chief Minister MK Stalin has called delimitation an issue that affects all of South India. He argued that states that have successfully implemented population control and economic development should not be penalised with reduced representation.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is because a situation has now arisen, according to which only a higher population would ensure more MPs as the delimitation exercise would be on the basis of population,&quot; Stalin was quoted as saying by The Indian Express.&nbsp; &quot;Tamil Nadu paid attention to population control and succeeded and that was the reason for the state&rsquo;s plight today,&quot; he added.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will not tell you to not have children hastily, have children immediately; but give them beautiful Tamil names,&rdquo; he said, while attending the wedding function of a DMK district secretary at Nagapattinam.&nbsp;Why Are Southern states opposing delimitation?&nbsp;1. Reduced political influence&nbsp;If delimitation is based purely on population, the South&rsquo;s parliamentary strength could shrink from 24 per cent to 19 per cent, while Hindi-speaking states would gain about 60 per cent representation.&nbsp;2. Economic contribution vs representation&nbsp;States like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra are among India&rsquo;s largest contributors to direct tax revenue, but they receive only 30 per cent of their contributions in return. Meanwhile, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh receive 250-350 per cent more than what they contribute.

Published by Henley & Partners, the index evaluates how investment-based residence and citizenship programs, when combined with premium education, create long-term success and prosperity.&nbsp; he Henley Opportunity Index evaluates multiple parameters like earning potential, career advancement, employment prospects, economic mobility, livability, and access to premium education to rank the best countries for investment migration. Here&rsquo;s a look at the top countries that offer the most promising opportunities for individuals seeking a global advantage.&nbsp; Top Investment Migration Program Options to Access the World&rsquo;s Best Opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;As competition for talent intensifies across the globe, the 2025 Henley Opportunity Index emphasizes the growing importance of investment migration as a strategy for securing a brighter future. With a focus on education, career growth, earning potential, and economic mobility, the report reveals that countries offering structured pathways to residency and citizenship are becoming increasingly sought after by families who view strategic relocation as key to wealth planning and career advancement.&nbsp;&quot;&ldquo;While studies confirm that tertiary graduates earn around 50% more than those with only secondary education, research also reveals that over two-thirds of income disparity worldwide is dictated by the country in which an individual lives and works. With barriers to opportunity often dictated by the limitations of our citizenship, the index makes a compelling case for investment migration as a game-changing strategy for families looking to transcend the constraints of their &lsquo;birthright lottery&rsquo;&quot; said Tess Wilkinson, Director of Henley & Partners Education.&nbsp;The Singapore Global Investor Program is popular among ultra-high-net-worth families, and the city-state is well-established as a world-class education destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, with its EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program offering an efficient route to permanent resident status and new &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; visa proposed, which would offer wealthy investors the right to live and work in the US and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment, is not far behind on 78%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia, which recently launched a new National Innovation Visa, comes in next with 76%, ahead of Canada, which offers a popular Start-Up Visa Program for entrepreneurs and scores 73%, rounding up the Top 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK, which has an Innovator Founder Visa requiring individuals to set up a new, scaling business in the country, secures an opportunity score of 70% when it comes to providing strategic advantage to its citizens and residents, and the UAE, which has numerous categories of beneficiaries for its Golden Residence visa, earns 67%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Austria, which requires a substantial contribution to its economy to secure citizenship, and New Zealand, which recently eased the rules for its Active Investor Plus Visa Program to incentivize investors, each achieve 65%, closely followed by Italy, which also offers an Investor Visa and scores 64% on the Henley Opportunity Index.&nbsp;Further down the list evaluating the possibility of future success is the cosmopolitan wealth hub of Hong Kong, which reintroduced its Capital Investment Entrant Scheme in 2024 and scores 61%, just ahead of rising star Latvia, whose residence by investment offering is one of the fastest and most competitive programs in Europe and scores 60%.&nbsp; Next is Malta, which offers an attractive pathway that allows for the granting of citizenship by a certificate of naturalization to foreign individuals and their families who contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic development, scoring 59%.&nbsp; Hungary, which offers a Guest Investor Residence Permit, follows with an opportunity score of 58%. Greece and Portugal, both scoring 56%, round out the rankings, with Greece&rsquo;s Golden Visa Program shooting up in popularity in the past 12 months, while Portugal&rsquo;s Golden Residence Permit Program has long been favored by investors from across the globe.&nbsp;&quot;By investing in these residence and citizenship programs, families can permanently relocate to regions that offer exceptional educational opportunities, professional development, and high-quality living standards. This significantly enhances earning potential and facilitates wealth creation across generations,&quot; said Wilkinson.&nbsp;&nbsp;She explains this with the following examples:&nbsp;A Vietnamese family with an opportunity score of just 29% in their home country could elevate their next generation&rsquo;s potential success to 78% by securing US residence through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. Similarly, an Indian family with a 37% score could boost their advantage to 84% by relocating to Switzerland via the Swiss Residence Program. In another example, a Nigerian family with a mere 21% opportunity score could dramatically increase their life chances to 79% by obtaining residence through Singapore&rsquo;s Global Investor Program, securing a remarkable advantage. Additionally, investment migration routes such as the UAE&rsquo;s Golden Visa and New Zealand&rsquo;s Active Investor Plus Visa offer next-generation opportunity advantages of 67% and 65%, respectively.&nbsp;&quot;Filipino investors leveraging Canada&rsquo;s Start-Up Visa Program would experience significant improvements in multiple aspects of their lives. Access to premium education would see a rise from a score of 32 out of 100 in the Philippines to 73 in Canada. Earning potential would also grow substantially, improving from 34 to 66. Career advancement opportunities would witness an even greater jump, surging from 35 to 74. Economic mobility would skyrocket from just 10 in the Philippines to 75 in Canada, and the family&rsquo;s total opportunity score would increase from 31% to 73%,&quot; said Henley & Partners in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Switzerland citizenship", "Henley Opportunity Index", "investment migration", "premium education", "global career opportunities", "residency by investment", "HNWIs", "Swiss residency program", "global mobility", "wealth planning", "education access", "economic mobility", "top investment migration programs.HNI", "HNI investment", "HNI luxury investing", "HNI market share", "Sensex", "Nifty", "mutual funds", "SIP", "Equity stocks", "debt funds", "Markets", "investors", "retail investors", "FII"], "date": "2025-03-05T12:08:33+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030500395", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:26"},

Here is a closer examination of the industrial competition in China and how &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; comes into play.&nbsp;What is Neijuan?The term &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; best translates to &lsquo;involution&rsquo; and can be better understood as &lsquo;involutionary competition&rsquo;. It describes a cycle of diminishing returns caused by intense competition. In simple terms, it means companies and individuals are forced to work harder and invest more, without seeing proportional benefits or returns.&nbsp;In business, this means companies slashing prices and overproducing to stay ahead, even if it hurts profitability.&nbsp;For workers, it describes a relentless rat race where individuals must continuously upskill, work long hours, and compete fiercely &ndash; without necessarily improving their quality of life.&nbsp;Chinese crack down on NeijuanNeijuan has been particularly visible in China&rsquo;s booming industries, where companies are undercutting each other in price wars, leading to lower profits and unsustainable business practices. The electric vehicle (EV) sector is a prime example, with fierce competition among brands driving aggressive price cuts.&nbsp;Response of Chinese govtThis is not the first time China&rsquo;s leaders have spoken about &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo;, but it is the first time it has been included in an official government work report. Over the past year, Beijing has intensified efforts to curb excessive competition and encourage more sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;Policy reforms: China aims to eliminate market fragmentation and local protectionism, making it easier for businesses to compete fairly.&nbsp;Stricter regulations: The government has pledged to crack down on destructive competition, ensuring industries focus on innovation rather than just price wars.&nbsp;Meetings with key industries: China&rsquo;s market regulator recently called in top companies from the technology, solar, and automotive sectors to discuss solutions for controlling &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo;.&nbsp;Promoting &lsquo;new quality productive forces&rsquo;: Beijing is shifting focus to high-tech sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and batteries, but overproduction remains a challenge.&nbsp;&ldquo;China will accelerate the establishment and improvement of fundamental institutional rules, eliminate local protectionism and market fragmentation, and remove bottlenecks in market entry and exit as well as resource allocation,&rdquo; Li stated during his address.&nbsp;Global competition ups pressure on Chinese firmsThe crackdown on &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; also comes amid rising tensions with the US and the European Union (EU). Western nations have accused China of &lsquo;dumping&rsquo; excess capacity into global markets, selling products at extremely low prices, which they claim is hurting their domestic industries.&nbsp;China, however, rejects these accusations, arguing that its industrial expansion is driven by innovation and genuine demand, not unfair trade practices. However, Beijing&rsquo;s increasing focus on regulating its industries suggests that even Chinese leaders are recognising the risks of unchecked competition.", "keywords": ["China neijuan crackdown", "neijuan industrial competition", "China excessive competition reforms", "Chinese Premier Li Qiang NPC speech", "China price wars regulation", "China economic slowdown policies", "neijuan electric vehicle market", "China anti-dumping accusations", "China market protectionism", "China business environment reforms", "China fair competition policies", "Chinese government work report neijuan", "China new quality productive forces", "China market entry and exit rules", "Beijing industrial regulation", "China business sustainability push", "China EU US trade tensions", "China overproduction crackdown", "Chinese market fragmentation reforms", "world news"], "date": "2025-03-05T18:10:13+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030500886", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:26"},

The number of passive funds available to investors has grown from 149 in 2020 to 537 by December 2024, shows data analysed by Morningstar.&nbsp;&nbsp;As this investment trend continues to grow, selecting the right index fund has become an essential skill for investors aiming to tap into passive investing&rsquo;s full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;While passive funds can be an efficient way to invest, subtle differences in cost, tracking efficiency, and index methodology can dramatically affect the returns on these investments.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a simple checklist by&nbsp;&nbsp;Kongkon Gogoi, Senior Analyst, Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India to help you select an index fund that meets your needs:&nbsp;1. Focus on the Asset Class FirstThe first step in choosing an index fund is to decide on the asset class or sub-asset class that best aligns with your investment goals. Are you interested in broad exposure to large-cap or mid-cap equities, government bonds, or a specific theme like sustainability or technology? Alternatively, you might be looking for specialized exposures such as factor investing (e.g., low volatility, growth, momentum, or value stocks). Understanding your broader investment objectives is key before diving into specific index options.&nbsp;2. Consider InvestabilityInvestability refers to how easily the securities within an index can be traded. Indexes that track illiquid securities can lead to higher transaction costs and performance drag. For example, while AAA-rated bonds issued by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and state development loans (SDLs) are relatively liquid, they are not as frequently traded as government bonds, which could create liquidity issues in certain market conditions.&nbsp;When evaluating an index, check whether there are investable products (ETFs or mutual funds) tracking the index. The presence of such products indicates that the index is practical for portfolio implementation and has sufficient liquidity.&nbsp;3. Diversification and RepresentativenessA key benefit of passive investing is diversification, which minimizes risks associated with individual securities. When selecting an index fund, ensure that the index you are investing in adequately represents the asset class or market segment. A highly concentrated index may introduce risks that undermine the benefits of diversification. While specialized or narrow indexes may seem appealing, they are typically better suited for tactical allocations rather than long-term, passive investing.&nbsp;4. Evaluate Index Construction MethodologyThe construction methodology of an index should be sound and based on an economic rationale. Indices like the Nasdaq-100 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, may have peculiar selection criteria that don&#39;t necessarily align with sound investment logic. An index that uses arbitrary rules or subjective decisions (such as the S&P 500, which relies on an investment committee) may not provide the transparency needed for long-term investing.&nbsp;Make sure the methodology of the index you are considering is transparent and based on objective criteria. This allows you to better predict the index&rsquo;s performance across market environments.&nbsp;5. Low TurnoverTurnover refers to the frequency with which the securities in an index are bought and sold. High turnover can lead to increased trading costs, especially in illiquid markets, which can diminish returns. A well-constructed index will seek to minimize unnecessary turnover. Look for funds that implement buffers for market-cap changes to limit turnover and reduce associated costs.&nbsp;6. Minimize Tracking ErrorEven the best-constructed index is only as good as its ability to track its underlying benchmark. Tracking error measures how closely an index fund&rsquo;s performance matches that of its index. A low tracking error indicates that the fund is replicating the index accurately and efficiently. Investors should prioritize funds with a stable and low tracking error to ensure their returns closely align with the performance of the underlying index.&nbsp;7. Role of Market MakersWhen it comes to ETFs, the role of market makers cannot be overlooked. Market makers ensure liquidity and fair pricing by continuously providing buy and sell quotes. ETFs with strong and multiple market makers tend to have narrower bid-ask spreads and more efficient pricing. In contrast, funds with fewer market makers may suffer from poor liquidity, especially during market volatility.&nbsp;In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has mandated that each ETF should have at least two market makers to enhance liquidity and pricing efficiency. Before investing, ask your ETF provider who the market makers are and how many are involved in facilitating smooth trading.&nbsp;The difference between a well-constructed, efficient fund and one that fails to deliver often comes down to the details: Is the index well-structured, investable, and sufficiently diversified? These elements directly impact performance and risk, separating funds that merely exist from those that truly deliver. And don&#39;t overlook the unsung heroes&mdash;market makers&mdash;who keep ETFs liquid and prices fair.&nbsp;A good index fund is more than just low fees. Focus on your due diligence and dig deeper before deciding. And when it comes to highly specialized thematic or narrowly focused indexes, be extra cautious&mdash;they may look compelling, but they don&rsquo;t always deliver the diversification and stability that passive investors rely on.&nbsp; Here are the key takeaways:&nbsp;Choosing the Right Asset Class Matters:&nbsp;Investors should first determine the appropriate asset class or sub-asset class before selecting a benchmark. Passive investing is most effective in efficient markets with broad coverage and high liquidity.&nbsp;Assessing investability:&nbsp;Some indices include illiquid securities, making them difficult to track and costly to replicate Even in relatively high-quality fixed-income indexes like CRISIL IBX 70:30 CPSE Plus SDL April 2025 Index, nuances in market depth can present challenges.&nbsp;Index construction and its pitfalls&nbsp;Not all index methodologies are well-grounded in economic rationale.The Nasdaq-100 Index restricts inclusion to companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, an arbitrary constraint that excludes several major firms and not much representative of the US equity marketThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), despite its prominence, is flawed due to subjective stock selection and outdated price-weighted methodology rather than market capitalization weighting. This results in an index that does not accurately reflect market opportunities.&nbsp;Diversification & representativenessA well-structured index should mirror the underlying market composition.Highly concentrated indices introduce idiosyncratic risks, reducing the diversification advantage of passive investing.&nbsp;Market makers:&nbsp; The overlooked backbone of ETF liquidity&nbsp;&nbsp;Market makers are critical to ETF efficiency, ensuring fair pricing, tight bid-ask spreads, and smooth trade execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak market-making support can lead to liquidity issues, price dislocations, and higher trading costs, negating the benefits of passive investing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors tend overlook this factor, but market depth and competition among market makers directly impact an ETF&rsquo;s tradability and cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Key question to ask: Who is providing liquidity for this ETF, and how effectively are they maintaining pricing stability?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking error & fund efficiency&nbsp;The ultimate goal of an index fund is to closely replicate its benchmark.&nbsp;Investors should prioritize funds with low tracking errors to ensure minimal deviation from index returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["passive investing", "Index funds", "large cap funds", "Actively managed funds", "ELSS fundsETF", "Passive funds", "mutual funds", "AUMs", "wealth management"], "date": "2025-03-07T09:08:28+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030700126", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:28"},

The dispute centres on allegations of trade secret misappropriation and anti-competitive practices within the healthcare software sector.&nbsp;Here&#39;s everything you need to know about the case.&nbsp;What are Cognizant&#39;s allegations against Infosys?&nbsp;In August 2024, Cognizant&#39;s subsidiary and healthcare software, TriZetto, filed a case in a court in Dallas, Texas, against Infosys for allegedly stealing their trade secrets. TriZetto&#39;s software suite, including platforms like Facets and QNXT, is widely utilised by healthcare insurance companies to automate administrative tasks such as claims processing and payments. The lawsuit claims that Infosys unlawfully accessed and extracted data from TriZetto&#39;s databases to develop and market competing software solutions&nbsp;Cognizant alleges that Infosys misused TriZetto&#39;s software to create &#39;Test Cases for Facets,&#39; which purportedly repackaged TriZetto&#39;s data into an Infosys product. Additionally, the complaint accuses Infosys of developing software to extract data from QNXT, encompassing confidential information and trade secrets. Cognizant is seeking monetary damages and an injunction to prevent Infosys from further exploiting its proprietary information.&nbsp;On February 7 this year, Cognizant filed a 22-page response in a Dallas court, alleging that Infosys was &quot;caught red-handed&quot; misappropriating trade secrets related to TriZetto.&nbsp;Cognizant claimed that Infosys had access to these trade secrets through Non-Disclosure and Access Agreements (NDAAs) but misused this information to develop competing products. Furthermore, Cognizant alleged that Infosys obstructed efforts to audit its use of TriZetto&#39;s information, which could have clarified the specifics of the alleged misappropriation.&nbsp;What are Infosys&#39; allegations against Cognizant?&nbsp;In January 2025, Infosys knocked on the doors of the federal court, alleging anti-competitive practices and the poaching of key executives to hinder the development of its healthcare platform, Infosys Helix. The IT major accused Cognizant&#39;s current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ravi Kumar, previously an Infosys veteran, of deliberately delaying the progress of its Helix Platform, which was designed to compete with Cognizant&#39;s TriZetto.&nbsp;Infosys claimed that Kumar, who joined Cognizant in January 2023, was also in charge of the development and sales of the platform, adding that he &quot;delayed the process&quot; since he was in talks with Cognizant. It further alleged that Kumar was &quot;aware of the confidential information and slowed Helix&#39;s launch by not allocating new talent to the project.&quot;&nbsp;&ldquo;His decisions effectively meant that, at the time, Infosys &#39;cannot do any new development&#39; for Helix,&quot; Infosys said, as reported by LiveMint.&nbsp;In its countersuit, Infosys accused Kumar of &quot;anticompetitive practices by maintaining its monopoly.&quot; Accusing him of misusing sensitive information, the IT firm sought a trial and three times the damages it claims to have suffered, Business Standard reported in January.&nbsp;What happened at February 28 hearing?&nbsp;Denying Cognizant&#39;s allegations in the court, Infosys said last week that &quot;Cognizant&rsquo;s mention of broad categories of trade secrets did not qualify as specific trade secrets that are alleged to have been stolen.&quot;&nbsp;The IT giant further urged the Dallas court to ask Cognizant to identify the alleged misappropriated trade secrets properly. The company denied Cognizant&rsquo;s allegations because the information about TriZetto was publicly available.&nbsp;&ldquo;The first six-plus pages of Cognizant&rsquo;s response are non-responsive background information about the Facets and QNXT software that reads like a marketing piece interspersed with legal argument,&quot;&nbsp; Infosys said in its 16-page reply to the court, as reported by LiveMint.&nbsp;Further, in its response, Infosys called out Cognizant&#39;s &quot;U-turn&quot; on how it wanted to file the &#39;legal documents.&#39; It stated that the lack of Cognizant&#39;s response is highlighted by its stance on how the documents may be filed publicly.&nbsp;Reiterating its stance, Infosys added not even a single test case related to the &#39;allegedly stolen trade secret&#39; was recognised by Cognizant.&nbsp;The case comes at a time when both Cognizant and Infosys are eyeing the second spot in the Indian IT services industry after Tata Consultancy Services.", "keywords": ["Infosys", "Cognizant", "Rajeev Mehta Cognizant", "IT firms", "Ravi Kumar", "IT TriZetto", "helix"], "date": "2025-03-06T18:37:36+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030600967", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:29"},

US President Donald Trump is pushing for a deal that would give the US partial access to the country&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp;Trump has said that Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth could be worth &ldquo;trillions of dollars&rdquo; and suggested that it should be used to offset the cost of US aid. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described the country&rsquo;s resources as &ldquo;priceless&rdquo; and is seeking security guarantees as part of any agreement.&nbsp;The growing demand for critical minerals and the global race to reduce reliance on China have heightened interest in Ukraine&rsquo;s deposits. But what are these minerals in Ukraine and what are they worth?&nbsp;What minerals does Ukraine have?Ukraine is believed to hold reserves of several rare earth elements, which are key materials used in military, technology, and renewable energy industries.&nbsp;Role of rare earth minerals in the militaryRare earths, a group of 17 chemically similar elements, are essential for manufacturing missiles, lasers, tanks, smartphones, and clean energy technologies.&nbsp;China currently dominates global rare earth processing, making alternative sources, such as those in Ukraine, particularly significant. However, while Ukraine is known to have some rare earth deposits, the full extent of these resources is unclear. Geological data from the Soviet era is outdated, and further surveys are needed to confirm the size and viability of these reserves.&nbsp;Scandium, one of Ukraine&rsquo;s rare earth elements, is used in military equipment and high-performance materials. Other rare earths found in the country include neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and yttrium, all of which are crucial for advanced technologies.&nbsp;What other critical minerals does Ukraine have?Beyond rare earths, Ukraine has reserves of several other critical minerals essential for defence and industrial production. These include:Titanium &ndash; Used in aerospace manufacturing and military applicationsGraphite &ndash; A key material in batteries and electric vehiclesLithium &ndash; Vital for rechargeable batteries and clean energy storageUranium &ndash; Crucial for nuclear energy production&nbsp;Ukraine&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources lie in occupied regionsIn addition to minerals, Ukraine has significant oil, natural gas, and coal reserves. However, much of its hydrocarbon wealth is in regions currently occupied by Russia. This includes offshore natural gas reserves near Crimea and coal deposits in eastern Ukraine. More than half of Ukraine&rsquo;s coal reserves and about 20 per cent of its natural gas fields are under Russian control.&nbsp;Moscow has even hinted at the possibility of granting the US access to these resources, further complicating negotiations.&nbsp;What are Ukraine&rsquo;s rare mineral reserves worth?Economists estimate that Ukraine&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources alone could be worth around $360 billion, as reported by NBC News. Meanwhile, broader estimates suggest that the country&rsquo;s total mineral and natural resource wealth could be valued in the trillions of dollars.&nbsp;As far as the rare earth minerals are concerned, extraction and processing challenges mean that the economic potential and exact value of these resources remains difficult to estimate.&nbsp;Trump has claimed that Ukraine could provide the US with $500 billion worth of rare earth minerals, but industry analysts dispute this figure. The entire global market for rare earths is estimated to be worth just $12 billion, according to NBC News, making Trump&rsquo;s valuation unrealistic.&nbsp;While Ukraine is known to have some rare earth deposits, the full extent of these resources is unclear.&nbsp; Much of the country&rsquo;s geological data dates back to the Soviet era and is considered unreliable. New surveys are needed to determine the full extent of Ukraine&rsquo;s rare earth deposits.&nbsp;Mining minerals: A major challenge in UkraineWhile Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth is attracting international interest, realising its full economic potential will not be straightforward. Extracting and processing these resources requires stable infrastructure, secure supply chains, and long-term investment, including rebuilding Ukraine&rsquo;s war-damaged power grid. The war in Ukraine has disrupted much of the country&rsquo;s industrial capacity, and restoring it will be a lengthy and expensive process.&nbsp;At present, no large-scale rare earth projects are underway in the country, and media reports estimate that it could take up to a decade to establish a functioning supply chain.&nbsp;Why does the US want Ukraine&rsquo;s rare minerals?Global competition for critical minerals has intensified, particularly as the transition to clean energy and advanced technology accelerates. Countries such as the US and European nations are looking to reduce their reliance on China for rare earth processing, and Ukraine&rsquo;s resources could play a role in diversifying supply chains.&nbsp;China currently dominates global rare earth processing, making alternative sources, such as those in Ukraine, particularly significant.&nbsp;Securing access to Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth could help the US reduce its dependence on China and Russia, both of which dominate global critical mineral supply chains. Washington has long viewed this reliance as a strategic vulnerability, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions. For Ukraine, leveraging its mineral wealth could bring economic benefits &ndash; but only if the right agreements are in place.&nbsp;During their meeting in Washington, the two leaders were expected to work out the details of a potential minerals deal. While their positions on the terms of the agreement differ &ndash; particularly on security commitments &ndash; both US and Ukrainian officials were keen to secure access to Ukraine&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp;Moscow has even hinted at the possibility of granting the US access to Ukraine&rsquo;s resources, further complicating negotiations.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Ukraine rare earth minerals", "US Ukraine mineral deal", "Ukraine critical minerals", "rare earths in Ukraine", "Ukraine titanium reserves", "Ukraine lithium deposits", "US critical mineral supply", "Ukraine mineral wealth", "China rare earth monopoly", "Ukraine Russia mineral conflict", "Ukraine mining challenges", "US mineral security", "clean energy minerals", "global mineral supply chain", "neodymium in Ukraine", "scandium reserves Ukraine", "graphite supply Ukraine", "Ukraine energy resources", "Ukraine natural gas reserves", "Ukraine war impact on mining", "US mineral independence", "European mineral security", "rare earth extraction Ukraine", "Ukraine titanium exports", "Donald trump Zelenskyy mineral deal"], "date": "2025-03-03T13:20:17+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030300434", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:29"},

The crash was fuelled by rampant speculation, excessive borrowing, and economic instability, leading to mass unemployment, food shortages, and widespread poverty.&nbsp;Black Monday (October 19, 1987)One of the most dramatic market crashes in history, Black Monday saw the DJIA plunge 22.6 per cent in a single day&mdash;the largest one-day percentage drop ever. Months of rapid stock gains had led to fears of an asset bubble, while a growing trade deficit and a weakening dollar further rattled investor confidence.&nbsp;Dot-com bubble burst (March 2000 - October 2002)The dot-com bubble burst after a period of rapid growth in IT and telecommunications. The rise of the internet led to an explosion of online businesses, attracting heavy investment. However, after peaking in March 2000, the Nasdaq crashed by about 78 per cent by October 2002 due to excessive speculation and failing tech startups.&nbsp;Post-9/11 market reaction (September 2001)Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, US stock markets remained closed for nearly a week. The destruction of the World Trade Center, a key financial hub, caused nearly 3,000 deaths and sent shockwaves through the economy.&nbsp;The airline and insurance industries were hit the hardest. With flights grounded for days, airline stocks saw steep losses. American Airlines and United Airlines, which operated the hijacked flights, suffered massive declines. The insurance industry also faced billions in claims, leading to a liquidity crisis for several firms.&nbsp;Global financial crisis (October 2008)The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a worldwide financial crisis. The Nasdaq, along with other major indices, experienced multiple days of declines exceeding 10 per cent. The crisis was driven by the collapse of major financial institutions, largely due to risky subprime mortgages and frozen credit markets. Banks, including those in the US and Northern Rock in the UK, had adopted a model where they originated and sold mortgages, packaging them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). In 2007, Northern Rock faced a run on deposits, which ended only when the UK government guaranteed them. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, plunging the global financial system into crisis. Government bailouts and stimulus measures were required to stabilise the financial system.&nbsp;Covid-19 market crash (March 2020)The Covid-19 pandemic caused extreme market volatility, with repeated 10 per cent+ drops in March 2020. Lockdowns, economic uncertainty, and investor panic led to trading halts.&nbsp;Major global market crashes&nbsp;2015 Chinese stock market crashBetween June 2014 and June 2015, China&rsquo;s Shanghai Composite Index surged 150 per cent, fuelled by speculative trading. By mid-2015, the bubble burst, causing a 32 per cent drop in a month and an overall 40 per cent decline.&nbsp;2022 Russian stock market crashFollowing Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) index fell 43.58 per cent in just four trading days in February 2022. Western sanctions and economic uncertainty fuelled panic selling, prompting Russia&rsquo;s central bank to halt trading temporarily.&nbsp;Major stock market crashes in India&nbsp;1865 cotton boom and bustOne of India&rsquo;s earliest market crashes was in May 1865, a decade before the Bombay Stock Exchange was incorporated. It was caused by excessive speculation in cotton exports during the American Civil War. When the war ended, cotton prices collapsed, triggering a severe market crash. Mumbai&rsquo;s economy suffered, and its population declined by 21 per cent over the next few years.&nbsp;1982 Reliance short-selling crisisA bear cartel attempted to crash Reliance Industries&rsquo; stock by offloading shares, driving prices down. In a few days, Reliance&rsquo;s share price dropped sharply. However, a counter-group known as the &ldquo;Friends of Reliance&rdquo; bought up shares, reversing the trend and stabilising the market.&nbsp;1992 Harshad Mehta scamStockbroker Harshad Mehta manipulated stock prices using fraudulent bank funds, inflating the BSE Sensex from 1,000 to over 4,500 points. When the scam was exposed, the market crashed by nearly 2,000 points, wiping out \u20b91 trillion in investor wealth.&nbsp;2008 global financial crisis impact on IndiaThe 2008 crisis led to foreign investors pulling out of Indian markets. The Sensex lost over 50 per cent of its value that year, with banks and financial stocks taking the worst hit.&nbsp;November 2016 demonetisationThe Indian government declared \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 notes would no longer be legal tender, causing a market shock. The BSE Sensex crashed nearly 1,689 points, while the NIFTY 50 fell 541 points.&nbsp;March 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crashThe Covid-19 outbreak led to panic selling across global markets, including India. The Sensex and NIFTY saw record single-day drops as lockdowns and economic fears spooked investors.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Nasdaq plunge", "biggest stock market crashes", "stock market crashes", "global financial crisis", "Wall Street crash", "Dalal Street collapse", "Great Depression", "dot-com bubble", "Covid-19 stock market crash", "2008 crisis", "Harshad Mehta scam", "demonetisation impact", "Chinese stock market crash", "Russian stock market collapse", "US recession fears", "Black Monday", "Lehman Brothers collapse"], "date": "2025-03-11T16:03:56+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125031100713", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:30"},

While there are signs of improvement led by targeted government efforts, a shift in attitude towards &lsquo;work&rsquo; among young Chinese has gained momentum over the past few years. While the west grapples with notions of &lsquo;quiet quitting&rsquo; or &lsquo;quiet vacationing&rsquo;, the shift on the east is best represented by the &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Let it rot&rsquo; movement, where young people are actively rejecting societal pressures to overwork and pursue conventional success.&nbsp;The &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; movement seems to stem from the &lsquo;Tang Ping&rsquo; movement, which gained prominence in 2021. Here is a look at how the youth of China have been dealing with disappointing market conditions over the last few years.&nbsp;What is &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo;?The term &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; literally means &ldquo;let it rot&rdquo;. It describes a mindset of voluntary retreat, where individuals choose not to fight against a difficult situation because they believe it is beyond their control. The phrase reflects growing disillusionment among young Chinese who feel that despite their efforts, economic and social success remains out of reach.&nbsp;This movement is closely related to another trend called &ldquo;Tang Ping&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lying flat&rdquo;. First gaining prominence in 2021, Tang Ping represents a rejection of excessive ambition and relentless work culture. Those who embrace it refuse to chase high-paying, high-stress jobs, instead opting for a low-desire lifestyle where they work only enough to meet their basic needs.&nbsp;Why are Chinese youth embracing &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tang Ping&rsquo;?According to media reports, several key factors explain the rise of these movements:&nbsp;Harsh job market: With high youth unemployment and an uncertain economy, many young people see little benefit in striving for career success.&nbsp;The 996 work culture: Many white-collar workers face a brutal schedule of 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, yet still struggle to afford housing, marriage, or a better quality of life.&nbsp;Soaring cost of living: Skyrocketing property prices and living expenses make it difficult for young people to achieve financial security.&nbsp;Lack of upward mobility: Many believe that no matter how hard they work, real success remains out of reach, especially for those from middle and lower-income backgrounds.&nbsp;For some, Bai Lan and Tang Ping are acts of silent resistance &ndash; a way to push back against societal expectations that demand endless productivity while offering little in return.&nbsp;How has the Chinese govt responded?China&rsquo;s leadership sees Bai Lan and Tang Ping as serious threats to economic growth and social stability. The government has responded with:Public campaigns promoting hard work: Officials have repeatedly emphasised the importance of hard work, ambition, and dedication to China&rsquo;s future.Job creation and policy reforms: Efforts to boost employment opportunities and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation are being introduced.Education reforms: Authorities are considering ways to align education with evolving job markets, pushing students towards practical and diverse career paths.However, these measures have met with mixed reactions. While some believe they are necessary to stabilise the economy, others argue that they are outdated solutions that fail to address the frustrations of young people.&nbsp;To motivate the youth, President Xi Jinping, in 2022, delivered an address outlining the role of the youth in &lsquo;national rejuvenation&rsquo;. He called on young people to channel their energy and creativity to the nation&rsquo;s development, emphasising their role in achieving the &lsquo;Chinese Dream&rsquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;For generations of youths in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realise their dreams,&rdquo; Jinping said.&nbsp;Is a larger cultural shift at play in China?The Bai Lan movement is not just about unemployment, it signals a major cultural shift in how young Chinese view work, success, and personal happiness.&nbsp;Traditional values that once emphasised stable jobs, marriage, and children are now being questioned, reflecting changing family and social expectations. Social media platforms, like Weibo and Douyin (China&rsquo;s version of TikTok), have also played a role in spreading the Bai Lan mindset, connecting like-minded individuals who embrace this outlook.&nbsp;However, if more young people continue to opt out of the workforce or reject the pursuit of high-paying careers, it could have long-term economic consequences, deepening challenges and widening income disparities.&nbsp;What is the unemployment rate in China?China&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate, which soared to a record high of 21.3 per cent in June 2023 due to a prolonged economic slowdown, has shown signs of improvement in recent months. Official data indicates that the rate declined for the third consecutive month in November 2024, suggesting a gradual easing of pressure in the job market. However, uncertainty among the youth appears to persist.&nbsp;On Wednesday, the Chinese government reported that in 2024, the country successfully created 12.56 million new urban jobs, achieving its annual goal. Earlier, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China noted that the surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 per cent last year, a slight improvement from 2023.&nbsp;For 2025, China has set its surveyed urban unemployment rate target at around 5.5 per cent.&nbsp;Despite these positive indicators, broader demographic challenges remain. For instance, marriage registrations in 2024 fell to their lowest level since 1980, reflecting deeper population concerns that could have long-term economic implications.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Bai Lan movement China", "Tang Ping movement China", "China youth unemployment", "Bai Lan let it rot", "China work culture crisis", "Chinese youth job market", "996 work culture China", "Xi Jinping youth employment", "Bai Lan vs Tang Ping", "China economic slowdown impact", "youth disillusionment China", "Chinese Dream vs Bai Lan", "China labor market reforms", "Weibo Bai Lan discussions", "social resistance in China", "China job creation 2025", "Chinese youth cultural shift", "China marriage rate decline", "China work-life balance debate", "Douyin Bai Lan discussions", "silent protest China workforce", "China urban unemployment rate", "world news"], "date": "2025-03-05T17:08:08+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030500829", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:31"},

In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!&rdquo; Trump wrote.&nbsp;He alleged that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents, suggesting potential criminal conduct by those involved.&nbsp;Trump also accused members of the &ldquo;Unselect Committee&rdquo; of manipulating the process and claimed the documents were signed without the knowledge or consent of &ldquo;the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is an autopen and why does it matter?&nbsp;An autopen is a device used to sign documents without direct human involvement. It has been in use by US presidents and lawmakers for decades. Barack Obama was the first president to use an autopen to sign an executive order, according to Newsweek.&nbsp;Interestingly, Trump himself has used an autopen extensively. A Daily Mail analysis found at least 25 identical Trump signatures on federal documents during his presidency, indicating autopen use.&nbsp;While George W Bush avoided using it due to legal concerns, Obama used it openly, notably for the 2013 fiscal bill. Legal experts have debated the validity of autopen signatures, especially on critical documents, but there is no definitive ruling against their use for executive actions.&nbsp;Allegations against Biden&rsquo;s autopen use&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s claims follow a report by the Oversight Project, a division of the conservative think tank behind Project 2025. The group alleged that Biden used an autopen to sign &ldquo;nearly every document we could find&rdquo; during his presidency.&nbsp;&ldquo;We gathered every document we could find with Biden&rsquo;s signature over the course of his presidency. All used the same autopen signature except for the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the race last year,&rdquo; the Oversight Project posted on X.&nbsp;????WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY????&nbsp; We gathered every document we could find with Biden&#39;s signature over the course of his presidency.&nbsp; All used the same autopen signature except for the the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the&hellip; https://t.co/CC3oJUkNr4 pic.twitter.com/mtNrZsALDu&mdash; Oversight Project (@OversightPR) March 6, 2025&nbsp;They presented three examples of Biden&rsquo;s autopen signatures on executive orders from August 2022 and December 2024, and a July 2024 letter where Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race. The two executive orders appeared to have identical autopen signatures, while the letter bore a different signature, possibly handwritten.&nbsp;Fox News reported reviewing over 20 executive orders signed between 2021 and 2024, all allegedly bearing identical autopen signatures.&nbsp;However, CNN reported in 2024 that autopen use in Biden&rsquo;s administration was rare. Biden went to great lengths to sign key documents in person, such as a $40 billion Ukraine aid package signed in South Korea and a bill to prevent a government shutdown signed while on holiday in St Croix.&nbsp;The Oversight Project has suggested Biden may not have personally approved these documents, raising questions about who controlled the autopen and what oversight was in place.&nbsp;Political and legal reactions&nbsp;The allegations have sparked strong political reactions. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Trump ally, sent a letter to the Department of Justice calling for an investigation into whether Biden&rsquo;s cognitive state allowed unelected staff to implement policies without his direct approval.&nbsp;Bailey argued that if Biden was not fully aware of the orders being signed, they would be &ldquo;null and void,&rdquo; and states had a right to know.&nbsp;He claimed that Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson was blocked by White House officials from meeting with Biden. Johnson later said in an interview that Biden appeared unaware of signing an executive order on energy exports, claiming he only authorised a study on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).&nbsp;The Oversight Project shared a video of Johnson&rsquo;s interview, alleging Biden lacked control over key decisions. Heritage Foundation attorney Samuel Dewey noted Hunter Biden&rsquo;s pardon signature seemed &ldquo;shaky&rdquo;, implying it was signed manually, unlike other autopen signatures.&nbsp;[With agency inputs]", "keywords": ["Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Autopen", "Presidential pardons", "Executive orders", "Autopen signatures", "Political controversy", "Oversight Project", "Biden autopen allegations", "Trump autopen use", "Legal concerns autopen", "Biden cognitive state", "Executive power", "Presidential signature", "Autopen debate", "Political manipulation", "Legal validity of autopen", "US government documents", "2024 presidential race", "Hunter Biden pardon"], "date": "2025-03-17T17:11:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125031700734", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:31"},

Over 30 police personnel were injured, with shops and vehicles gutted, leading to a curfew in several areas. Similar clashes occurred in June 2023 in Maharashtra&rsquo;s Kolhapur after social media posts allegedly glorified the Mughal ruler.&nbsp;Aurangzeb, the 17th-century Mughal emperor, remains a polarising figure. His over 50-year reign saw significant economic growth for India, but he is often remembered as a ruthless tyrant who allegedly hated music and ordered the destruction of several Hindu temples. While popular narratives describe his policies as intolerant towards non-Islamic faiths, some historians argue they were more politically motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s &lsquo;reign of terror&rsquo;&nbsp;Born Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad on November 3, 1618, in Dahod, Gujarat, Aurangzeb was the third son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. He ascended to the Mughal throne in 1658 after a power struggle, which included defeating his brother Dara Shikoh and imprisoning his father until the latter&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;Unlike his great-grandfather Akbar, known for his secular policies, Aurangzeb was less tolerant towards non-Muslims. He re-imposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims, which had been abolished by Akbar. Aurangzeb also ordered the destruction of some Hindu temples. The most noted act of his tyranny was the execution of the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, for refusing to convert to Islam. The Zafarnama, a letter written in 1705 by the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, indicts Aurangzeb for moral and spiritual bankruptcy, highlighting Guru Tegh Bahadur&rsquo;s sacrifice to save Hindus from forced conversion.&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s achievements&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s nearly 50-year reign from 1658 to 1707 marked the Mughal empire&rsquo;s greatest territorial extent, with significant military campaigns in South India. He successfully conquered the Deccan states, including Bijapur in 1686 and Golconda in 1687, extending the empire to cover about 4 million square kilometers by 1689, with a population over 158 million. His campaigns also reached southern regions like Tanjore and Trichinopoly, though maintaining control was challenging.&nbsp;Historian Angus Maddison estimates that in 1700, India accounted for approximately 25 per cent of the global GDP, surpassing the combined GDP of Europe at that time. This period also marked a phase of proto-industrialization, with India producing about 25 per cent of the world&rsquo;s industrial output up until the 18th century, excelling in sectors such as textiles, shipbuilding, and steel.&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s personal life included copying the Quran and sewing caps for a living, reflecting his piety, which contrasts with the ruthless ruler image often portrayed.&nbsp;Divide among historians&nbsp;While the destruction of temples under Aurangzeb&rsquo;s rule is highlighted, some historians note that he made exceptions in granting land and support to places of worship of Hindus and other faiths. In &lsquo;Aurangzeb: The Man and the Myth,&rsquo; historian Audrey Truschke notes the grant given by Aurangzeb to Jangam, a Shaivite group. Truschke also claims that there was a higher proportion of Hindus in Aurangzeb&rsquo;s administration compared to Akbar, arguing that his actions were often politically driven, not solely religious.&nbsp; In &#39;Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (Volumet 2),&#39; historian Satish Chandra notes that the Mughal ruler commissioned grants to some of the &quot;Vaishnava temples at Vrindavan, to the jogis at Jakhbar in Punjab, to the Nath Panthi jogis in Sarkar Nagaur, and grant of 100 pakka bighas of land to Panth Bharati in pargana Siwana in Rajasthan.&quot; He also gave grants to the gurdwara of Guru Ram Das in Dehradun, Chandra states.&nbsp;However, historian John F Richards opines that Aurangzeb&rsquo;s ultimate aim was the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam. In his book &lsquo;The Mughal Empire,&rsquo; part of The New Cambridge History of India series, Richards states, &ldquo;Whenever possible the emperor gave out robes of honour, cash gifts, and promotions to converts. It quickly became known that conversion was a sure way to the emperor&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;&nbsp;Contested legacy&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s legacy remains deeply contested, with interpretations of his rule varying between tyranny and pragmatism. While his policies contributed to the Mughal Empire&rsquo;s territorial expansion and economic strength, his religious intolerance and political ruthlessness left lasting scars. As debates over his reign continue to fuel contemporary tensions, his place in history remains as divisive as ever.", "keywords": ["Aurangzeb", "Mughal history", "17th-century India", "Aurangzeb&rsquo;s rule", "Mughal empire", "temple destruction", "Aurangzeb achievements", "Guru Tegh Bahadur execution", "Akbar vs Aurangzeb", "medieval India", "jizya tax", "Mughal administration"], "date": "2025-03-19T13:46:37+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125031900535", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:31"},

The court also barred her from contesting public office for five years&mdash;a decision that could significantly affect the 2027 presidential elections. Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate and one of President Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s key political opponents, has vowed to appeal the ruling.&nbsp;The verdict has shaken France&rsquo;s political establishment and is likely to influence European politics as well. Here&rsquo;s a closer look at who Marine Le Pen is and why the verdict matters.&nbsp;Who is Marine Le Pen?Marine Le Pen, 56, is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, which was later renamed the National Rally (Rassemblement National, RN). A populist figure known for her anti-immigration stance, Le Pen has tried to moderate the party&rsquo;s image since taking over leadership in 2011.&nbsp;Under her watch, the party moved away from its more openly extremist rhetoric, changed its name, and aimed to appeal to a broader electorate. Despite this rebranding, her platform remains staunchly nationalist and socially conservative. She has campaigned for increasing police forces, banning the Muslim headscarf in public spaces, and curbing immigration.&nbsp;Le Pen&rsquo;s popularity has grown in recent years. Her party emerged as the largest bloc in the National Assembly following the 2024 snap elections called by President Macron.&nbsp;What does the National Rally party stand for?Founded in 1972 by Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front&mdash;now the National Rally&mdash;has historically aligned with far-right ideals, including Euroscepticism and anti-immigration. While under Marine Le Pen&rsquo;s leadership the party has softened its tone and abandoned its push for France to leave the EU, it remains committed to limiting Brussels&rsquo; influence.&nbsp;Its electoral campaigns have focused on immigration control, cost-of-living issues, crime, and national sovereignty&mdash;key concerns among a growing segment of French voters.&nbsp;What was the embezzlement case against Le Pen?Le Pen and 23 senior party figures were accused of misusing European Parliament funds between 2004 and 2016. The funds were meant for paying parliamentary assistants but were allegedly diverted to pay staff working for the party in France, including a bodyguard and a private secretary.&nbsp;The scheme is estimated to have cost European taxpayers around &euro;4 million. During her trial, Le Pen denied wrongdoing, stating she committed &ldquo;no irregularity.&rdquo; However, the court concluded she was central to an organised effort to divert EU funds.&nbsp;Presiding judge B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte de Perthuis said the severity of the fraud and Le Pen&rsquo;s refusal to acknowledge the misconduct justified both the financial penalty and the political disqualification.&nbsp;What is Marine Le Pen&rsquo;s sentence?Following a three-hour court hearing, Le Pen was sentenced to two years under house arrest, enforced with an electronic monitoring device, and received an additional two-year suspended sentence. She was also fined &euro;100,000.&nbsp;The National Rally was fined &euro;2 million, half of which is suspended.&nbsp;Although Le Pen remains a sitting member of the National Assembly, she is barred from standing for public office until at least 2029 unless her appeal succeeds. With the 2027 presidential race approaching, the ruling could dramatically alter France&rsquo;s political landscape.&nbsp;&lsquo;A political witch hunt&rsquo;: Le Pen&rsquo;s response&nbsp;Le Pen walked out of the courtroom before the sentence was delivered in full and convened an emergency meeting at party headquarters in Paris. Later, she spoke to reporters, calling the ruling a &ldquo;political decision&rdquo; intended to eliminate her from public life.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will not allow myself to be taken out like this,&rdquo; she told TF1, promising to appeal &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;She alleged the ruling was timed to weaken her party&rsquo;s momentum and likened the situation to authoritarian regimes. &ldquo;Millions of French people are outraged,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Impact on French politicsLe Pen&rsquo;s conviction and disqualification could trigger a major shift in the political balance. Her National Rally has been the most formidable opposition to Macron&rsquo;s centrist government. If she is unable to run in 2027, it could leave the far right without a unifying figure.&nbsp;One possible successor is Jordan Bardella, 29, the current National Rally president. Bardella has been touted as a strong contender for European and national leadership roles.&nbsp;The appeal process could stretch over months or even years, leaving Le Pen&rsquo;s future&mdash;and the opposition&rsquo;s leadership&mdash;uncertain. The verdict comes as the party enjoys record-high polling numbers, making the timing particularly consequential.&nbsp;Is this Le Pen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Trump mugshot&rsquo; moment?The sentencing has drawn comparisons to former US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s legal battles. Some European commentators have described this as Le Pen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trump mugshot&rdquo; moment, suggesting it could galvanise her support base or position her as a political martyr.&nbsp;Although Le Pen had previously distanced herself from Trump&mdash;particularly after his tariff measures targeting Europe&mdash;both Trump and Elon Musk have publicly backed her.&nbsp;Musk criticised the verdict on social media, claiming it &ldquo;will backfire, like the legal attacks against President Trump.&rdquo; Trump added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big deal&hellip; sounds very much like this country,&rdquo; drawing parallels with his own ongoing legal woes.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Marine Le Pen", "Emmanuel Macron", "EU funds fraud", "National Rally", "Jordan Bardella", "far-right", "Elon Musk", "Donald Trump", "French politics", "Le Pen verdict", "world news"], "date": "2025-04-01T15:39:56+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040100705", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:34"},

The Bill has sparked protests from Muslim organisations, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).&nbsp;Background and Opposition concerns &nbsp;&nbsp;Initially introduced in August 2023 amid strong opposition, the Bill was subsequently referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) led by BJP MP Jagadambika Pal. After months of deliberation, the committee submitted its report on February 13 this year, which the Union Cabinet approved on February 19. However, opposition MPs on the panel have raised concerns that their proposed amendments were rejected and their dissent notes were omitted without their knowledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;The JPC accepted 14 changes suggested by NDA members while rejecting all 44 amendments proposed by opposition MPs.&nbsp;The panel&#39;s deliberations were also marked by disruptions. TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee was suspended for a day after allegedly disrupting proceedings and smashing a bottle on the table.&nbsp;Additionally, six opposition MPs &mdash; including Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), Mohammad Jawed (Congress), Sanjay Singh (AAP), Mohammed Nadimul Haque (TMC), and MM Abdulla (DMK) &mdash; wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, accusing Pal of &ldquo;bulldozing the proceedings.&quot;&nbsp;In their letter, the opposition members said, &ldquo;We, the members from the Opposition, feel that the constitution of the panel, i.e., a mini Parliament, should not be treated as a mere ventilating chamber to get the Bill passed as desired by the government, ignoring the parliamentary process by using the so-called &lsquo;majority&rsquo; undemocratically. Hence, it is our duty to bring to your notice with pain that bulldozing the proceedings of the parliamentary committee without assigning reasonable and plausible time pause as against the will of the members is nothing but an act of atrocious onslaught on the Constitutional religion and Parliament.&quot;&nbsp; Read: Waqf Amendment Bill LIVE&nbsp;What is Waqf? &nbsp;&nbsp;Waqf refers to a charitable or religious endowment in the form of property, primarily within the Muslim community. These properties are often donated without formal documentation, and their proceeds are used to maintain mosques, graveyards, madrasas, and orphanages. &nbsp;&nbsp;Key provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;The government asserts that the proposed amendments aim to enhance the administration and management of waqf properties. According to an official statement issued in September 2023, the Bill seeks to &quot;overcome the shortcomings of the previous Act and enhance the efficiency of Waqf boards by introducing changes such as renaming the Act, updating the definition of Waqf, improving the registration process, and increasing the role of technology in managing Waqf records.&quot;&nbsp;However, opposition parties and Muslim organisations have strongly opposed the Bill, calling it &quot;unconstitutional&quot; and detrimental to the interests of the Muslim community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Controversial provisions&nbsp;Among the many proposed changes, five provisions have drawn significant criticism from Muslim organisations, including the AIMPLB: &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Changes to waqf council and state boards&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Bill mandates the inclusion of non-Muslims in the central waqf council and state waqf boards, a move seen as an encroachment on Muslim affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Dispute resolution by government officials &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In cases of dispute, a senior state government official will have the final say on whether a property belongs to waqf or the government. This replaces the existing system where such decisions are made by waqf tribunals.&nbsp;3. Restructuring of waqf tribunals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Bill proposes changes to the waqf tribunal&rsquo;s composition, which will include a district judge and a state government official of joint secretary rank. Additionally, tribunal decisions can be challenged in the high court. &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Mandatory property registration &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Every waqf property must be registered on a central portal within six months of the law taking effect. However, the waqf tribunal may extend this timeline in specific cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;5. Removal of &#39;waqf by user&#39; clause &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This clause, which allowed properties to be recognised as waqf if used for religious or charitable purposes over time without formal documentation, has been scrapped. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Following an intervention by NDA ally TDP, the JPC has recommended that this change should not be applied retrospectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;Waqf row: Political fallout &nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has ignited a heated political debate, with the Opposition accusing the government of targetting Muslim religious institutions. AIMIM MP Owaisi has been at the forefront of the criticism, calling the Bill a direct attack on religious freedoms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This Bill is unconstitutional. If no non-Hindu can become a member of the Hindu Endowment Board, then why are you making a non-Muslim here?&quot; Owaisi questioned, referring to the proposed restructuring of the waqf council. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, Union Minister of Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju has dismissed these allegations, accusing the Opposition of misleading the Muslim community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Some people are saying that the Bill is unconstitutional. Waqf rules, its provisions have been in existence since before Independence... then how can it be illegal?&quot; Rijiju said, denying claims that the Bill seeks to seize waqf properties.", "keywords": ["Waqf Amendment Bill 2024", "Waqf Bill", "Waqf Bill row", "Waqf Bill protests", "what is Waqf Bill", "Waqf Bill explained", "Waqf Bill controversy", "Waqf Bill timeline", "Waqf Bill owaisi", "Waqf Bill proposals", "Waqf Bill provisions", "Waqf Bill controversial provisions", "Waqf Bill meaning", "Centre introduces Waqf Bill", "Waqf property", "Waqf law changes", "Parliament Waqf Bill", "Waqf protests", "Opposition on Waqf Bill", "Waqf Tribunal", "Waqf Council", "Waqf board explained", "Waqf Bill news", "Waqf Bill latest", "Waqf Bill all you need to know", "Waqf Bill all details", "Waqf Bill amendment bill"], "date": "2025-04-02T09:27:54+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040200206", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:34"},

Tarigami, without naming Muralitharan, called for a clarification from the government.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am told a former Sri Lankan cricketer has been allotted land, which is an evacuee property, that too without [the cricketer] paying any penny. This is a serious matter. Land is not on sale for all. My concern is that the law of the land should be applicable equally to all. In this case, norms have been flouted,&rdquo; Tarigami said, as reported by The Hindu.&nbsp;Congress MLA Ghulam Ahmed Mir also sought an explanation from the government, questioning the decision to allot land to a non-Indian cricketer in Kathua without financial consideration. &ldquo;Why has a non-Indian cricketer been given land in Kathua without getting a penny from him?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;What did the government say?&nbsp;Responding to the Opposition&#39;s charges, Jammu and Kashmir Minister for Rural Development Javed Dar said the government had no information on the matter but would investigate. &ldquo;This is a matter related to the revenue department.

The film delved into the &quot;sensitive subject&quot; of the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat with a &quot;clear and alarming bias&quot;, it alleged.&nbsp;Political controversy&nbsp;The criticism soon took a political turn with the Congress and Left parties accusing the BJP of showing intolerance towards the movie.

The performance of debt funds has been a key indicator of this shift, signaling potential headwinds for equity markets in the coming months.&nbsp;For the first time since 2011, debt funds are seeing a 1-year rolling period outperform equity funds, and the underperformance of equity funds in February 2025, which reached 4.7%, marks the largest gap since 2018. Historically, such periods of underperformance in equity funds have been followed by multiple rounds of correction in the stock market, suggesting that a similar phase may be underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the concern is a growing trend of underperformance in active funds compared to passive funds. Active strategies, which typically involve more flexibility and active management, have struggled to keep pace with the more stable and predictable passive funds. This marks the first significant instance of active funds underperforming since 2023, with earlier periods of similar performance seen in 2011-2014 and 2018-2020. During those phases, large-cap stocks, especially those within the Nifty Top-10, led the market&#39;s outperformance. This trend could be another indicator of a weakening equity environment.&nbsp;Shift Back to Larger Names and Weaker Market Breadth&nbsp;&nbsp;Further signs of a deteriorating equity environment are emerging with the shift in index weights back to larger names in the market. The weight of the top 50 stocks in the NSE500 index has been steadily increasing since May 2020, indicating a growing preference for larger companies over smaller ones. This trend of market polarization is often a leading indicator of weak economic or earnings growth ahead. Historically, such phases of market polarization have been accompanied by weak market breadth and sideways or correcting markets, which signals that investors may want to reallocate funds towards large-cap stocks to avoid further underperformance.&nbsp;This shift is reminiscent of previous market downturns, including those seen in 2008-2009, 2010-2013, and 2018-2020, when smaller companies underperformed, and liquidity in mid and small-cap stocks faded. As this trend continues, it suggests that investors should be cautious about smaller-cap stocks, which could face additional pressure as liquidity dries up.&nbsp;Addition of new folios&ndash; Smallcap folio addition rate drops to 2-year low. Midcap & Thematic also plunge&nbsp;Rate of new folio addition in Mutual funds gives an indication of the breadth of Retail participation. While flows will be influenced by the size of the investor, new folio addition will be a better reflection of breadth of investor participation.&nbsp;&quot;In Feb&rsquo;25, Equity funds saw addition of 1.8 million folios, which is the slowest monthly addition since November 2023. This was largely on back of slowest folio addition in Midcap, Smallcap and Thematic/Sectoral funds. What is more concerning is that bulk of new investors in Midcap and Thematic/Sectoral funds came into markets post election results of June 2024. And a meaningful portion of these investors are already sitting on losses. Although, we have still not seen much impact on flows, these could be initial leads of flows turning weak going ahead,&quot; said Sunil Jain of Elara Capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means: Of concern is the fact that many of the new investors in mid-cap and thematic funds entered the market after the June 2024 election results and are now sitting on losses, indicating that investor sentiment may be weakening.&nbsp; Cash levels surge: &nbsp; Another worrying sign for equity markets is the sharp increase in cash levels held by fund managers, particularly in mid-cap and small-cap funds. Cash levels in large-cap schemes have expanded to 4.8%, the highest since June 2023, while mid-cap and small-cap funds have seen similar increases. The total cash held across all active equity schemes now stands at Rs1.74 trillion ($20 billion). Rising cash levels as a percentage of free-float market cap reflect a lack of conviction among fund managers, potentially due to fears of further market declines and a slowdown in retail flows.Changes in Mutual Fund Allocation and increased focus on large caps &nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual fund allocations change &nbsp; In line with these developments, mutual fund allocation is also starting to shift, particularly in the Flexicap schemes, which allow more flexibility in investing across market caps. These schemes have seen a slight reduction in their allocation to small-cap stocks, now holding 10.5% of their assets in small caps, down from 12% in October 2024. This is a significant trend as Flexicap funds are typically seen as a bellwether for investor sentiment. As the allocation to small-cap stocks decreases, the focus is shifting more toward large-cap stocks, suggesting that fund managers are preparing for continued market uncertainty.&nbsp;Signs of Domestic Panic in the Market&nbsp;Finally, one of the most telling indicators of potential market instability is the rising percentage of equity schemes hitting their 52-week lows. Historically, such spikes have been an early sign of a larger market downtrend. In March 2025, the percentage of equity schemes hitting their 52-week lows surged to 45%, signaling an initial panic among investors. Previous cycles, such as in 2008, 2011, and 2018, saw similar spikes followed by more significant corrections. If this trend continues, the market may experience a deeper sell-off in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Debt funds", "mutual funds", "accrual funds", "equity funds", "market correction"], "date": "2025-03-25T12:34:46+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125032500412", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:37"},

Moreover, programs like Skill India and AI-driven workforce development are enhancing the employability of professionals, he said.India produces over 2.5 million STEM graduates annually, providing companies with a steady pipeline of skilled professionals.In addition, India continues to offer a significant cost advantage over Western markets, making it a preferred destination for global companies looking to optimise their hiring and operational expenses.&quot;Competitive salary structures, lower recruitment costs, and a strong talent pool contribute to India&#39;s position as a key global talent hub,&quot; Khandelwal added.According to Khandelwal, in order to maintain its competitive edge in talent acquisition, India must accelerate its upskilling pace as the country needs more high-skill professionals to meet AI and semiconductor industry demand.He further noted that work-life balance is evolving and companies should focus on productivity-driven work models.Citing a EY GCC Survey 2024, he said around 50 per cent of global organisations plan to expand their GCC presence in India, creating opportunities in R&D, automation, and data analytics.The specific industries that are witnessing a surge in hiring include GCCs, as India remains a preferred location for expansion due to cost, talent availability, and scalability.Moreover, government incentives, global supply chain shifts, and private sector investments are driving rapid hiring in chip design and manufacturing. The other sectors that are witnessing a surge include AI & cybersecurity, with data security becoming a global priority, India is emerging as a hub for cybersecurity talent.The digital payments boom is fuelling recruitment in risk management, analytics, and AI-driven fraud prevention, while hiring in renewable energy, carbon accounting, and sustainability consulting is increasing amid rising adoption of sustainability and green energy.According to the 2025 Michael Page Salary Guide, the most sought-after skills include -- AI & Machine Learning, Cybersecurity & Cloud Computing, Semiconductor Design & Engineering, Data Science & Advanced Analytics and SaaS Product Management & GTM Strategy.", "keywords": ["Formal sciences", "Artificial intelligence", "Computational neuroscience", "Cybernetics", "Data science", "UST", "Analytics", "ANSR", "Global capability centers", "Executive Search Services", "semiconductor", "official of global recruitment firm", "green energy", "chip design", "Michael Page India", "risk management", "Machine Learning", "manufacturing", "renewable energy", "Michael Page", "artificial intelligence", "Nilay Khandelwal", "India", "Managing Director", "carbon accounting"], "date": "2025-04-10T11:36:01+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000261", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:54:38"},

Its lawsuit alleged that the three &ldquo;co-orchestrated and executed a lawless scheme&rdquo; to conceal and steal $533 million of loan proceeds (the Alpha Funds). Byju&rsquo;s Alpha is debtor and plaintiff in the lawsuit. &lsquo;Business Standard&rsquo; has asked Byju Raveendran for a comment.&nbsp;The lawsuit follows a $533 million judgment of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware against Riju Ravindran, younger brother of Byju, and the edtech firm&rsquo;s ultimate corporate parent in India.&nbsp;&ldquo;On the heels of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court&rsquo;s recent judgment against his brother (Riju) and companies, this action is being brought to now hold Byju Raveendran, the former CEO [chief executive officer] of Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, and two more of his co-conspirators &ndash; namely his co-founder and close business associate &ndash; accountable for their roles in masterminding the theft of more than half a billion dollars,&rdquo; said the lenders of Byju&rsquo;s Alpha&rsquo;s term loans in the lawsuit.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is clear that Byju, Divya, and Anita deliberately hid the assets of Byju&rsquo;&rsquo;s Alpha and repeatedly were deceptive about the location of the money in order to steal funds rightfully owed to the Lenders. In light of the court&rsquo;s recent decision, there can be no doubt that they acted unlawfully and tried to cover their tracks, breaching fiduciary duties and making numerous misrepresentations, among other misconduct, in the process. If it is not abundantly clear to them by now, Byju and his cohorts will soon learn that the laws of the United States are immutable, and they can either choose to live the rest of their days as international fugitives or face the music and return the money they stole,&rdquo; alleged the lenders.&nbsp;Byju&rsquo;s Alpha is seeking an award of damages for Byju&rsquo;s alleged breach of fiduciary duties, as well as an award of damages for the actions of Byju, Divya, and Anita in aiding and abetting the breach of others&rsquo; fiduciary duties. It also seeks an accounting of the Alpha Funds and an award of damages for conversion and civil conspiracy. Additionally, Byju&#39;s Alpha is requesting reimbursement of all attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs, and expenses, reimbursement of interest expenses, and any other relief that the Court may deem just, proper, or equitable.&nbsp;Starting March 2022, months after receiving term loans, Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, which was then under the control of the Byju&rsquo;s enterprise, defaulted on the credit agreement, according to the lawsuit. In April, the lenders said Byju&rsquo;s began the first in what was a series of systematic and unlawful fraudulent transfers of the Alpha Funds. Byju and his Riju personally conceded defaults had occurred by entering into numerous amendments and forbearances to the credit agreement.&nbsp;In mid-2022 Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, acting at the behest of Byju, Divya and Riju, started transferring $533 million of Alpha Funds to Camshaft Capital Fund, LP (the Camshaft Fund). The lenders alleged it was a sham hedge fund with no investment track record and a listed headquarters with the same address as a pancake restaurant, ostensibly in exchange for receiving a limited partnership interest in the Camshaft Fund.&lsquo;Missing $533 million&rsquo;The lenders alleged that Byju Raveendran, wife Gokulnath and Kishore repeatedly misrepresented and contradicted themselves regarding the use and location of the $533 million Alpha Funds.&nbsp;Following discovery by Timothy R Pohl, a restructuring professional who replaced Riju as sole director of Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, of the transfers of the Alpha Funds to Camshaft, on September 13, 2023, the lenders said that edtech firm Byju&#39;s released a statement in which it &ldquo;categorically denie[d] media reports which insinuated that Byju&#39;s was no longer a beneficiary owner of the funds,&rdquo; instead representing that &ldquo;an offshore subsidiary remains the beneficiary of the money invested in high security fixed income instruments invested with a multi-hundred billion dollar fund in the U.S.&rdquo; Camshaft, however, was not a &ldquo;multi-hundred billion dollar fund,&rdquo; and no &ldquo;high security fixed income instruments&rdquo; were received on account of the Alpha Funds.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is impossible to square Byju&#39;s representations with his repeated statements to the Court, investors, the public, and the lenders over the prior two years.

In the end, he had to hit pause, but vowed to try again Thursday.Don&#39;t doubt us, Johnson said, after a more than hourlong huddle with GOP lawmakers. Just give us a little space to do our work.Pushing the budget framework forward would log another milestone for Johnson, who had set a deadline of the congressional spring break recess Thursday for advancing the resolution. A failed vote, particularly as the economy was convulsing over Trump&#39;s trade wars, would be a major setback for the Republican agenda in Washington.Stop grandstanding! Trump had admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum on Tuesday night.Trump told the Republicans, Close your eyes and get there.But by Wednesday afternoon, the outcome was in flux. At least a dozen conservative Republicans stood firmly against the plan. Several of them, including leaders of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, made the unusual move of walking across the Capitol to meet privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts.As night fell, Johnson pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room off the House chamber. House proceedings came to a standstill.Johnson said he spoke with Trump for about five or six minutes in a side room while the GOP meeting was taking place. This is part of the process, Johnson said afterward.I&#39;m very optimistic about the outcome of this, this one big, beautiful bill,&#39; he said. We want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here, and we have a small subset of members who weren&#39;t totally satisfied with the product as it stands.But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remained concerned that the Senate GOP&#39;s blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.The Math Does Not Add Up, Rep Chip Roy posted on social media. He said he would not support it.Rep Andy Harris, the chair of the Freedom Caucus, led others to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Senate GOP leaders.Sen John Barrasso, the GOP whip, exited a short time later calling it a very positive meeting. &quot;The House and the Senate Republicans are all on the same page, and we&#39;re all committed to serious and significant savings for the American taxpayers, Barrasso said.Voting would provide another step in a process that will take weeks, if not months. The House and Senate must resolve their differences in a final product with more votes ahead later this spring or summer.Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.Pennsylvania Rep Brendan Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, said the proposed GOP budget cuts in either the House or Senate version would deeply harm Medicaid, the health care programme used by tens of millions of Americans.This will have a devastating impact on my district, my state and all 435 congressional districts throughout our land, Boyle said.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans&#39; budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy.We&#39;re here to make it clear, Jeffries said. Hands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.The budget framework starts the process of the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump&#39;s first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump&#39;s mass deportation operation and as much for the Defence Department to bolster military spending.It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session Maine Sen Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House&#39;s framework, while Kentucky Sen Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on fishy math that would add to the debt.The package would also boost the nation&#39;s debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 mid-term election.With Trump&#39;s trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action as the Senate has taken to disapprove of Trump&#39;s tariffs.", "keywords": ["Reconstruction Era", "Republican Party", "Republicanism in the United States", "Right-wing populism in the United States", "Congress", "final product", "John Barrasso", "social media", "Democratic Leader", "White House", "accounting method", "National Building Museum", "Andy Harris", "President", "United States", "Speaker", "whip", "Majority Leader", "Washington", "chair", "Paul", "Brendan Boyle", "House", "Defence Department", "Mike Johnson", "New York", "Donald Trump", "John Thune", "Susan Collins", "Senate", "Department of the Treasury", "Hakeem Jeffries", "Rand Paul", "Chip Roy"], "date": "2025-04-10T07:43:27+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000093", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:55:24"},

OpenAI said it has suffered damages in light of Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; actions and is seeking a jury trial.&nbsp;A lawyer for Musk didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;In the court fight Musk launched last year, he accused OpenAI of abandoning its founding purpose as a charity when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft Corp. starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI&rsquo;s board.&nbsp;A federal judge in Oakland, California, has set a March trial in Musk&rsquo;s challenge to Altman&rsquo;s plans to transform OpenAI from a nonprofit to a more conventional, public benefit for-profit company, setting the stage for a high-stakes clash between the two billionaires.&nbsp;In the counterclaims it filed Wednesday, OpenAI said the unsolicited February offer to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion by Musk and a coalition of deep-pocketed investors was a &ldquo;sham bid&rdquo; to thwart the startup&rsquo;s ability to raise funds and harm its relationships with investors and customers.&nbsp;Altman, OpenAI&rsquo;s chief executive officer, had spurned the buyout offer, saying OpenAI is &ldquo;not for sale,&rdquo; and his board rejected it, too. The bid was a &ldquo;very public effort&rdquo; to artificially inflate the nonprofit&rsquo;s valuation and &ldquo;has already caused confusion,&rdquo; OpenAI said in its filing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing also includes an amusing allegation: &ldquo;The purchase price noted in the Letter of Intent was a joking reference to 974 Praf, a character in Iain Banks&rsquo; science fiction series, Look to Windward, from which Musk has also drawn names for multiple SpaceX rockets&rdquo;&nbsp;If the price tag Musk put on the startup&rsquo;s valuation is &ldquo;pursued further, the consequence could be a significant impairment of OpenAI&rsquo;s ability to pursue its mission on terms uncorrupted by unlawful harassment and interference,&rdquo; Altman&rsquo;s company said.&nbsp;OpenAI also pointed to the $100 billion Stargate venture by OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank announced by the White House shortly after President Donald Trump took office in late January.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In private, trying to strangle the venture in the cradle, Musk encouraged any investor who would listen not to invest in Stargate,&rdquo; according to OpenAI&rsquo;s filing.&nbsp;Musk has previously accused OpenAI of trying to eliminate competitors, such as xAI, by extracting promises from investors not to fund them &mdash; a claim that OpenAI has denied.&nbsp;OpenAI said last week that it finalized a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank. The deal values the company at $300 billion including dollars raised &mdash; almost double the ChatGPT maker&rsquo;s previous valuation of $157 billion from when it raised money in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;In late March, xAI, which Musk launched in 2023, acquired the X social media platform, formerly Twitter, which he also controls, giving the new combined entity, called XAI Holdings, a value of more than $100 billion, Bloomberg News reported.&nbsp;The case is Musk v.

Speaking at the Startup Mahakumbh 2025, Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal questioned the direction of India&rsquo;s booming entrepreneurial sector. His remarks &mdash; &ldquo;Are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls?&rdquo; &mdash; highlighted concerns that while India&rsquo;s startups celebrate unicorn valuations, they may not be focusing on deep-tech and critical sectors like their global counterparts.&nbsp;The contrast is stark. While India produces food delivery and fantasy sports apps, China is investing aggressively in semiconductors, AI, electric vehicles (EVs), and robotics. Other nations, including the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Japan, are also prioritising long-term innovation in high-tech industries. The question arises: Is India&rsquo;s startup ecosystem built for the future, or is it stuck in the cycle of short-term digital convenience?&nbsp;In the past two decades, China and India were seen as twin engines of global startup growth, backed by large populations, rapid digitisation, and venture capital inflows. But by 2024, China had decisively pulled ahead. Companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance became global leaders, while many Indian startups, despite early promise, struggled with scale and profitability.&nbsp;How did China&rsquo;s startup scene explode?&nbsp;China&rsquo;s startup dominance was not an accident&mdash;it was the result of deliberate government policies, aggressive funding, and a domestic market structured for scale.&nbsp;Unlike India, where startups face regulatory hurdles, China&rsquo;s government actively fostered innovation. As a result, by 2023, China accounted for 40 per cent of global venture capital funding, dwarfing India&rsquo;s 5 per cent. Beijing&rsquo;s $1.4 trillion tech investment plan (2015&ndash;2025) far outstripped India&rsquo;s $150 billion allocation. In 2024 alone, China slashed $361 billion in taxes and fees for high-tech firms, including $80.7 billion in R&D deductions.&nbsp;Both India and China, with their approximately 1.4 billion-strong populations, offered startups a vast testing ground before expanding internationally. In 2024, Alibaba&rsquo;s Singles&rsquo; Day sales hit $203.6 billion&mdash;surpassing the value of India&rsquo;s entire e-commerce market, which stood at $147.3 billion. Meanwhile, TikTok, developed by ByteDance, reached one billion users before entering Western markets, while India&rsquo;s ShareChat still struggles to cross 400 million.&nbsp;Where did India&rsquo;s startups falter?&nbsp;Despite an initial surge, Indian startups began to struggle with funding shortages, profitability concerns, and a lack of focus on high-tech industries. While Chinese startups benefited from state-backed funding and predictable policies, Indian startups faced tighter capital access and regulatory unpredictability.&nbsp;In 2023, Chinese startups raised $45.4 billion in venture capital funding. In the first half of 2024 alone, that figure stood at $26 billion, according to a report by the South China Morning Post. In comparison, Indian startups raised $13.7 billion in all of 2024, and a meagre $9.6 billion in 2023.&nbsp;Indian startups overwhelmingly focused on digital services, while China prioritised industrial technology and manufacturing. In 2024, Indian deep-tech startups received $1.6 billion in funding. China&rsquo;s VC deal value in AI and semiconductors alone stood at $12.3 billion in 2024&mdash;a decline from previous years, but still far ahead of India&rsquo;s total deep-tech inflow. In 2023, just 5 per cent of Indian startup funding went into deep-tech sectors, compared to 35 per cent in China. Meanwhile, India&rsquo;s semiconductor industry remained in its infancy, relying heavily on imports.&nbsp;Indian startups remain focused on consumer service&nbsp;India&rsquo;s startup ecosystem has flourished in sectors such as food delivery, digital payments, and online services. Companies like Zomato and Swiggy have strengthened last-mile logistics, while wellness platforms like Cure.fit and HealthifyMe have gained traction. The fintech sector continues to expand, driving digital financial services, and e-commerce aggregators have reshaped consumer convenience. However, unlike global hubs, India&rsquo;s startup landscape lacks a strong deep-tech foundation.&nbsp;In contrast, China and other nations have heavily invested in foundational technologies. Companies like BYD and NIO are leading advancements in EV and battery technology. DJI has revolutionised drone technology, while ByteDance leverages AI for content platforms. National strategies such as &lsquo;Made in China 2025&rsquo; and China&rsquo;s AI development plans highlight long-term commitment to innovation.&nbsp;One exception for India is SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), where companies like Zoho and Freshworks have built global reputations.&nbsp;Where did Chinese startups outpace Indian tech innovators?&nbsp;China has taken the lead in deep-tech sectors, while India is still developing its ecosystem. Companies like BYD and CATL are at the forefront of the EV revolution, whereas India is still in the early stages of setting up EV infrastructure. In semiconductors and AI, China has aggressively funded research, while India remains in the nascent phase despite introducing incentives.&nbsp;China&rsquo;s AI-driven factories have transformed manufacturing through robotics and automation, while India continues to rely on labour-intensive methods. In global trade and e-commerce, companies like Shein, DJI, and Alibaba dominate international markets&mdash;India lacks comparable global players. Additionally, China&rsquo;s long-term investments in space technology, high-speed rail, and renewable energy stand in contrast to India&rsquo;s startup sector, which remains focused on digital convenience over deep-tech infrastructure.&nbsp;Lack of skills for core innovation sectors in India&nbsp;China built a vast talent pipeline for deep-tech industries, while India has continued to grapple with a shortage of high-skilled researchers. In 2024, China&rsquo;s total R&D spending reached $496 billion, while India allocated \u20b920,000 crore ($23.45 billion) to the Department of Science and Technology (DST) to initiate a private-sector-driven R&D fund in the FY25 Budget.&nbsp;China had 2.2 million R&D workers in 2022&mdash;2.5 times more than India&rsquo;s 900,000 professionals working across over 1,140 R&D centres (according to 2022 data).&nbsp;Can India catch up?&nbsp;Despite the current gap, India&rsquo;s startup ecosystem is not out of the race. Recent policy changes and shifting industry trends point to potential for a turnaround.&nbsp;While China dominates hardware, India is making inroads in software and enterprise tech. With 65 per cent of its population under the age of 35, India has a demographic advantage&mdash;but it can only leverage this if it builds a skilled workforce.&nbsp;China surged ahead by combining government support, deep-tech investment, and a massive domestic market. India, meanwhile, has struggled with capital shortages, regulatory friction, and a strong tilt towards consumer-facing apps.&nbsp;That said, no startup ecosystem follows a fixed path. India still has the opportunity to rewrite its story. But for now, China remains in a different orbit &mdash; and India faces a steep climb ahead.", "keywords": ["India startups vs China", "deep-tech startups India", "Piyush Goyal startups", "AI startups China", "EV innovation China", "India startup challenges", "semiconductor policy India", "India SaaS Zoho Freshworks", "China vs India innovation", "Startup Mahakumbh 2025"], "date": "2025-04-04T17:55:12+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040400979", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:55:30"},

Therefore, these are areas where India needs to make a big breakthrough.&quot;&nbsp;Kant urged startups to follow good corporate governance models. &quot;Many of you (startups) are constantly innovating, and then you forget the governance part of it but good governance must become a very critical part.

He cited examples of tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba, mentioning that the global companies that are leading innovation initially took off as consumer tech companies.&nbsp;&quot;Why doesn&#39;t India have its own large-scale foundational AI model? It&#39;s because we still haven&#39;t built great internet companies. Most technology-led innovation over the past two decades has originated from consumer internet companies. Who scaled cloud computing? Amazon (originally a consumer internet company). Who are the big players in AI today? Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, etc, (all started as consumer internet companies),&quot; Palicha added.&nbsp;Emphasizing the need to champion consumer tech platforms, Palicha said these companies drive innovation as they have a pool of data, talent, and capital. &quot;The startup ecosystem, the government, and the owners of large pools of Indian capital need to actively support the creation of these local champions, not pull down the teams that are trying hard to get there,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Not just Palicha, former Infosys chief financial officer Mohandas Pai also criticized Goyal for his comments.&nbsp;In a social media post on X, Pai wrote: &quot;Minister Piyush Goyal should not belittle our startups but ask himself what has he done as our Minister to help deep tech start-ups grow in India? It is easy to point fingers at them.

This marks Ankur Capital&rsquo;s first investment from its newly launched third fund. The funding will support Vimano&rsquo;s mission to power the energy transition, with its membranes serving as critical components for redox flow batteries, electrolysers for green hydrogen production, and proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.&nbsp;While the global energy transition is progressing, aided by the steadily falling cost of solar energy, key technological hurdles persist. These include the high cost of green hydrogen production and the absence of cost-effective long-duration energy storage (LDES) solutions. These challenges remain significant barriers to the decarbonisation of heavy industries and a fully renewables-powered grid.&nbsp;Founded in 2019 by materials scientists Murari Ramkumar (chief executive officer) and Nagesh Kini (chief technology officer), Vimano was built on the belief that advanced materials can unlock a new era of energy storage. Its tunable ion-conductive membrane platform has led to the development of membranes that significantly reduce the cost of electrolysers used in green hydrogen production and other LDES systems. Over five years of research, Vimano claims to have addressed key problems related to membrane conductivity and performance, achieving high efficiency, low crossover, and long operational life.&nbsp;The investment will allow Vimano to initiate pilot projects with strategic partners in the energy ecosystem, expand its team, and establish a scalable manufacturing process for its membranes.&nbsp;&ldquo;At Vimano, we believe membrane electrolytes are the unsung heroes of the energy transition. Over the past five years, we have worked relentlessly to develop a platform that can significantly improve efficiency and reduce costs for long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen production,&rdquo; said Murari Ramkumar, chief executive officer, Vimano. &ldquo;This investment will enable us to accelerate our commercialisation efforts and bring our high-performance membranes to market at scale.&rdquo;&nbsp;Ritu Verma, managing partner at Ankur Capital, said Vimano&rsquo;s work in nanotechnology aligns with the firm&rsquo;s strategy of backing deep science innovations addressing global challenges such as the energy transition. &ldquo;We believe Vimano&rsquo;s membranes can reshape how energy is stored across multiple formats &mdash; with green hydrogen alone projected to grow nearly ten-fold to over $60 billion by 2030,&rdquo; said Verma.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Vimano", "nanotechnology startup", "energy storage", "green hydrogen", "Ankur Capital", "seed funding", "PEM fuel cells", "redox flow batteries", "electrolyser membranes", "energy transition", "renewable energy", "long-duration energy storage", "LDES", "materials science", "climate tech startup", "Vimano funding", "clean energy innovation", "India startup", "deep tech", "Bengaluru startup"], "date": "2025-04-07T14:49:49+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040700583", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:55:31"},

It also coincides with climate superfund legislation gaining traction in various states.Trump has declared a national energy emergency and ordered his attorney general to take action against states that may be illegally overreaching their authority in how they regulate energy development.American energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities, Trump said in the order.He said the attorney general should focus on state laws targeting climate change, a broad order that unmistakably puts liberal states in the crosshairs of Trump&#39;s Department of Justice.Michael Gerrard, director of the Columbia University&#39;s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it would be an extraordinarily bold move for the federal government to go to court to try to overturn a state climate law.Gerrard said the quickest path for Trump&#39;s Department of Justice is to try to join ongoing lawsuits where courts are deciding whether states or cities are exceeding their authority by trying to force the fossil fuel industry to pay for the cost of damages from climate change.Democrats say they won&#39;t back downDemocratic governors vowed to keep fighting climate change.California Gov Gavin Newsom accused Trump of turning back the clock on the climate and said his state&#39;s efforts to reduce pollution won&#39;t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.New York Gov Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cochairs of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which includes 22 governors, said they will keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis.&quot;Climate superfund laws are gaining tractionVermont and New York are currently fighting challenges in federal courts to climate superfund laws passed last year. Trump suggested the laws extort payments from energy companies and threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.Both are modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law, which taxed petroleum and chemical companies to pay to clean up of sites polluted by toxic waste. In similar fashion, the state climate laws are designed to force major fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on their past greenhouse gas emissions.Several other Democratic-controlled states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and California, are considering similar measures.The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and natural gas industries, applauded Trump&#39;s order that it said would protect American energy from so-called climate superfunds.&#39;&nbsp;Directing the Department of Justice to address this state overreach will help restore the rule of law and ensure activist-driven campaigns do not stand in the way of ensuring the nation has access to an affordable and reliable energy supply,&quot; it said.Court battles are already ongoingThe American Petroleum Institute, along with the US Chamber of Commerce, filed the lawsuit against Vermont. The lawsuit against New York was filed by West Virginia, along with several coal, gas and oil interests and 21 other mostly Republican-led states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia.Make Polluters Pay, a coalition of consumer and anti-fossil fuel groups, vowed to fight Trump&#39;s order and accused fossil fuel billionaires of convincing Trump to launch an assault on states.The order, it said, demonstrates the corporate capture of government and weaponises the Justice Department against states that dare to make polluters pay for climate damage.Separately, the Department of Justice could join lawsuits in defense of fossil fuel industries being sued, Gerrard said.Those lawsuits include ones filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and dozens of cities and states seeking billions of dollars in damages from things like wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms.In the last three months, the US Supreme Court has declined to get involved in a couple climate-themed lawsuits.One was brought by oil and gas companies asking it to block Honolulu&#39;s lawsuit. Another was brought by Alabama and Republican attorneys general in 18 other states aimed at blocking lawsuits against the oil and gas industry from Democratic-led states, including California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.Trump&#39;s order set off talk in state Capitols around the US.That includes Pennsylvania, where the governor is contesting a court challenge to a regulation that would make it the first major fossil fuel-producing state to force power plant owners pay for greenhouse gas emissions.John Quigley, a former Pennsylvania environmental protection secretary and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, wondered if the Department of Justice would begin challenging all sorts of state water and air pollution laws.This kind of an order knows no bounds,&quot; Quigley said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to say where this could end up.", "keywords": ["Anthropocene", "Climate change", "Human impact on the environment", "Donald Trump", "Fossil fuel", "Energy development", "Climate change policy of the United States", "Environmental policy of the first Donald Trump administration", "Texas", "New Jersey", "West Virginia", "Vermont", "Ohio", "Minnesota", "planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution", "President", "University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center", "Alabama", "Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law", "high-tech manufacturing", "John Quigley", "energy dominance", "state climate law", "energy emergency", "oil and gas", "natural gas industries", "Oregon", "Hawaii", "energy supply", "american petroleum institute", "New York", "oil", "Gavin Newsom", "Department of Justice", "Connecticut", "U.S. Climate Alliance", "federal superfund law", "American Petroleum Institute", "energy", "energy production", "greenhouse gas emissions", "oil and gas industry", "US Supreme Court", "Governor", "federal government", "cloud computing applications", "artificial intelligence", "electricity demand ramps", "director", "the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy"], "date": "2025-04-10T10:12:26+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000215", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:55:32"},

This movement was notably initiated by China, aiming to reduce its reliance on the US dollar, which dominates global currency markets.&nbsp;A major reason behind this strategy is that gold serves as a hedge against currency fluctuations and economic instability. In today&rsquo;s climate of heightened geopolitical tension, gold is viewed as a dependable investment that remains independent of any single currency or government.&nbsp;Should investors follow suit and increase their investments in gold?&nbsp;&ldquo;Gold is considered a safe-haven asset class, which witnesses robust demand and increased fund flows during times of economic uncertainty.

Considering recent market fluctuations and the rise in demand, gold&rsquo;s prices remain unpredictable, which makes it a less dependable asset class for investment compared to Nifty, which has shown stable and consistent returns over the last 25 years.&nbsp;It is also observed that Indian households and investors have a much higher allocation to gold than investors worldwide.&nbsp;&ldquo;If we take a look at the risk-adjusted return of Gold vs Nifty 50, we can see from the above table that Nifty has delivered better returns while adjusting risk in a 5-year time frame with a higher efficiency ratio. Hence, higher allocation to equity would provide better return and benefits for an investor,&rdquo; Shenoy said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In the near future, four factors will push gold prices up. Ongoing uncertainty due to trade war, and further escalation, risk of developed nations specially the US, slipping into a recession, geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and the Middle East, and Central banks buying gold. This will push gold prices upwards, adding sheen to its long-term appeal. Hence, it is advisable to invest in gold during these times as it provides a hedge to the portfolio and safeguards it from potential losses.

The MPC has also changed the policy stance to Neutral from accommodative, indicating an intent to support economic growth amid rising global uncertainties.&nbsp;Following this, the shares of rate-sensitive sectors like automobiles, real estate, and financials, including banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and housing finance companies (HFCs), settled mixed on Wednesday. Among them, FMCG, auto, and consumer durables managed to eke out gains of up to 1.78 per cent.&nbsp; Banking indices on the NSE, on ther other hand, ended lower, with Nifty PSU Bank being the top laggard, settling down by 2.52 per cent, dragged by Indian Bank and Central Bank of India.&nbsp;A cut in the repo rate, along with the adaptation of an accommodative policy stance, Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Investments, said, is taken as a constructive step. &quot;However, it has done little to uplift overall market sentiment, as the world is embracing recessionary risk. The IT sector continues to lag ahead of Q4 results, which are estimated to be weak.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, the Nifty IT index settled down by over 2.19 per cent, dragged by HCL Tech, TCS, and LTI Mindtree.&nbsp;Pharma, Nair believes, remains cautious over potential headwinds arising from the imposition of US tariffs on the industry. &quot;On a positive note, domestic focus sectors like FMCG are trading better due to the lack of recessionary risk from the global slowdown,&quot; Nair said.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Ajit Mishra &ndash; SVP, research, Religare Broking, expects the ongoing volatility to continue to keep traders cautious, and any near-term relief seems unlikely given the recent tariff-related developments and the onset of the earnings season.&nbsp;Notably, The fear index (India VIX), which gauges the volatility in the markets, settled higher by 4.83 per cent at 21.43 points on Wednesday. &quot;Until volatility, as reflected by the elevated India VIX, cools off, we recommend maintaining a hedged approach to navigate potential sharp swings,&quot; Mishra said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, he believes investors will react to the IT major, TCS&rsquo;s results in early trades on Friday, which could influence market direction initially.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably, the Indian equity markets will remain closed on April 10, 2025, on account of Shri Mahavir Jayanti.Nifty50 short-term trend remains weak, faces resistance at 22,500Nifty50, on the daily charts, has formed a small inside-body candle, which, Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research at Kotak Securities, said, indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and the bears. Chouhan believes that the current market texture is non-directional, and traders may be waiting for a breakout in either direction.&nbsp;&quot;For day traders, 22,350 would act as a key support zone, while 22,500 could be the key breakout level for the bulls. If the market falls below 22,350, it could retest levels of 22,250&ndash;22,200, while a break above 22,500 could push the market toward 22,650&ndash;22,700,&quot; said Chouhan.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities, also expects the trend to stay weak below 22,500, with a breakout potentially driving the index to 22,750&ndash;22,800. Failure to cross 22,500 may drag it down toward 22,000, De said.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["RBI's rate cut", "closing bell", "Markets", "closing bell today", "sensex", "nifty", "sensex today", "nifty today", "nse", "bse", "rbi rate cut", "repo rate", "rate sensitive stocks", "interest rates trump tariffs", "trump tariffs impact", "it stocks", "it stocks today", "pharma stocks", "auto stocks", "nifty it", "us trade tariffs", "us tariffs", "nifty pharma", "nifty auto", "bank nifty", "stock market news", "trump tariff news", "sun pharma share price", "Infosys share price", "top sensex gainers", "top sensex losers", "trump tariffs impact on india"], "date": "2025-04-09T16:39:30+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900797", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:55:44"},

Other top losers included Balkrishna Industries, which fell 4.48 per cent to \u20b92,452.05, and Samvardhana Motherson International, which decreased 3.4 per cent to \u20b9127.73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bajaj Auto&rsquo;s shares dropped 2.88 per cent to \u20b97,840, while Tata Motors saw a decline of 2.61 per cent to \u20b9654.30.

This could lead to increased prices and reduced demand for Indian automotive products in the US,&rdquo; analysts at Anand Rathi said, in a note dated April 2, 2025.&nbsp;According to Arun Agarwal, VP, fundamental research, automobiles, Kotak Securities, US has imposed 25 per cent tariffs on imported cars, light trucks and select auto parts sourced from outside of North America. Further, almost 150 auto parts will face tariffs at similar rate. This move could result into increase in car prices in the US and cost pressure for component suppliers.&nbsp; &quot;In the event of car prices going up, the US car market may witness a steep volume decline and that can impact revenue for component players supplying parts to the US car/light truck industry. Further, margins of suppliers may come under pressure as they may need to partly absorb cost pressures. We believe there will be some impact, which the suppliers will have to bear, leading to negative implications on margins. Having said that, it needs to be seen on how higher tariffs are absorbed across the supply chain that includes customers, OEMs and suppliers. The extent of impact for Indian players will also depend on the US-India bilateral agreement over the next few months,&quot; Agarwal added.&nbsp;By 11:04 AM, the Nifty Auto index had made a recovery, trading 0.54 per cent lower at 21,293.65 levels.", "keywords": ["auto stocks", "Auto component export", "Auto stocks fall on Trump&rsquo;s 25% tariff", "auto tariffs", "Trump tariffs", "Auto components industry", "auto demand", "Auto sector", "Auto sales", "Tata Motors Jaguar Land Rover", "Tata Motors JLR", "Tata Motors", "Share price", "Trending", "Market trends", "BSE Sensex", "Nifty Auto index", "Nifty Auto", "Motherson Sumi stock", "Motherson Sumi", "Bosch", "M&M", "Balkrishna Industries", "Bharat Forge", "Trump tariffs", "Donald Trump", "import tariffs", "Auto ancillaries", "Auto makers", "stock market trading", "Markets Sensex Nifty", "MARKETS TODAY", "S&P BSE Sensex", "Nifty50", "Hero MotoCorp", "Maruti Suzuki", "Exide Industries", "Bajaj Auto"], "date": "2025-04-03T11:37:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040300398", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:55:56"},

This is intended to help graduates stay housed while they search for work.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s on offer&nbsp;Under the plan:&lt; Rental reimbursements are split into two phases: 50% of rent (up to &pound;300 or Rs 33,500 per month) for the first three months, and 80% (up to &pound;500 or Rs 55,800 per month) for the next three.&lt; Students also get access to &pound;400 (about Rs 44,600) worth of additional medical services in India, mental health and teleconsultation support, free flight tickets back to India, and insurance cover up to Rs 2 lakh.&nbsp;The full package costs &pound;799 (around Rs 89,100, inclusive of taxes). To qualify:&lt; The student must be an Indian national&lt; They must be enrolled in a course longer than six months in the UK&lt; Accommodation must be booked through University Living&lt; Payment of &pound;799 must be completed before departure from India&nbsp;To claim rental benefits, students need to have graduated with at least 70% and be unemployed at the time of application. Those who don&rsquo;t meet the academic threshold won&rsquo;t be eligible for payouts.&nbsp;There is no cap on the number of students who can register for the product.&nbsp;Rental costs rising in major cities&nbsp;Rental expenses in major UK cities have continued to rise, adding to the financial pressure on international students. According to University Living, monthly average rent ranges are currently:London: &pound;900&ndash;&pound;1,200 (Rs 1 lakh&ndash;1.34 lakh)Birmingham: &pound;700&ndash;&pound;1,000 (Rs 78,000&ndash;1.12 lakh)Leeds: &pound;500&ndash;&pound;800 (Rs 56,000&ndash;89,000)Manchester: &pound;600&ndash;&pound;800 (Rs 67,000&ndash;89,000)Glasgow: &pound;600&ndash;&pound;800 (Rs 67,000&ndash;89,000)&nbsp;Claims process and documents required&nbsp;Flashaid will handle the digital claims through the reimbursement portal: https://www.universityliving.com/UES&nbsp;Applicants must provide:&lt; A certificate from their university confirming unemployment&lt; Registration proof with job agencies&lt; Evidence of job applications and interview outcomes&nbsp;The plan does not cover unemployment linked to visa issues, legal matters, or if the student left a job voluntarily.&nbsp;Why now?&nbsp;&ldquo;The transition from university to a professional career can be both exciting and uncertain for international students.

This is the second cut in recent months&mdash;after February&rsquo;s move from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent.&nbsp;With the latest decision, EMIs are expected to come down, especially for those with repo-linked home loans.&nbsp;&ldquo;The lowest rates we&rsquo;re currently seeing are between 8.10 and 8.35 per cent. However, the lowest rates are usually for prime borrowers with credit scores above 750 or for refinance cases,&rdquo; said Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com.&nbsp;What it means for borrowers&nbsp;&mdash; Lower repo rate can lead to reduced EMIs for those with repo-linked home loans&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Borrowers paying more than 50 basis points above the current market rate may benefit from refinancing&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Floating rate borrowers with older loans still linked to MCLR or base rate may not see an immediate drop&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Only repo-linked loans pass on rate changes quickly and in full&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Despite six years since repo-linking began, only 50 per cent of floating rate loans with public sector banks are on repo-based pricing. Around 2 per cent are still on base rate,&rdquo; said Shetty. &ldquo;Borrowers should check their loan type and consider shifting to a repo-linked home loan if they can save on interest.&rdquo;&nbsp;Why this cycle is different&nbsp;Arsh Mogre, economist at PL Capital, said the current rate environment is supportive for credit transmission.&nbsp;&ldquo;With over 60 per cent of bank loans now linked to the External Benchmark Lending Rate, mainly the repo, this cut will be passed through more directly and quickly,&rdquo; said Mogre. &ldquo;The real policy rate is now around 2.4 per cent, and possibly 2 per cent looking ahead. This gives the RBI space for another 75&ndash;100 basis points of easing, which could bring the repo down to 5.0&ndash;5.25 per cent by the end of FY25.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mogre said this could bring down home loan rates by 100&ndash;125 basis points over the course of the cycle, creating meaningful savings for borrowers.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you have a \u20b950 lakh loan at 10 per cent for 20 years, your EMI is \u20b948,251. At 8 per cent, it falls to \u20b943,391&mdash;a monthly difference of nearly \u20b94,900 or \u20b911.7 lakh over the tenure,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Not everyone may benefit immediately&nbsp;Some experts remain cautious about how soon the benefits will reach borrowers.&nbsp;&ldquo;Banks haven&rsquo;t fully passed on earlier rate cuts due to higher funding costs, pressure on margins, and risk concerns,&rdquo; said Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group.&nbsp;&ldquo;If they do pass on the latest two cuts, it would be helpful for homebuyers, especially those in the affordable housing segment. Many first-time buyers who&rsquo;ve been on the fence may finally act if rates drop,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;What borrowers can consider now&nbsp;Mogre suggested five options for borrowers:&nbsp;1. Wait a few months before locking rates &ndash; repo cuts take 1&ndash;2 months to show up in EBLR-linked loans. Those planning fresh loans may benefit from waiting till late 2025, when cumulative cuts are more fully priced in&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Switch to EBLR if still on MCLR or base rate &ndash; MCLR-linked loans transmit slowly. Over FY19&ndash;24, EBLR passed on 85&ndash;95 per cent of rate cuts, while MCLR managed only 65&ndash;70 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Refinance fixed-rate loans &ndash; fixed-rate loans, especially from NBFCs or HFCs, are often priced at 9.5&ndash;10 per cent. If penalties are low, moving to floating-rate loans may bring down outgo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Use lower EMIs to boost eligibility &ndash; a 100 basis point drop in interest rates can increase loan eligibility by 5&ndash;7 per cent, allowing buyers in high-cost cities to afford bigger homes or top-up loans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Consider prepaying &ndash; if the rate cut brings down EMIs, use the savings to reduce the loan principal or invest elsewhere instead of increasing spending&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Home loan borrowers should keep expectations realistic,&rdquo; said Puri. &ldquo;Even if EMIs fall, the priority should be to pay down the loan faster or put the savings to better use.&rdquo;", "keywords": ["home loan", "home loan EMI", "EMI calculator", "repo rate cut", "EMI savings", "refinance loan", "switch to EBLR", "prepay loan", "loan eligibility", "floating rate", "fixed rate", "MCLR", "base rate"], "date": "2025-04-09T11:52:11+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900392", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:56:12"},
{"url": "https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/upi-transaction-limits-set-for-revision-what-rbi-decision-means-for-you-125040900571_1.html", "title": "UPI transaction limits set for revision: What RBI decision means for you", "content": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday announced an update to the transaction limits on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allowing for greater flexibility in both Person-to-Person (P2P) and Person-to-Merchant (P2M) payments. Currently, the limit for UPI transactions is capped at Rs 1 lakh, with some P2M transactions allowing limits of Rs 2 lakh or Rs 5 lakh. Under the new guidelines, these limits will be revised based on evolving user needs, with appropriate security measures in place to mitigate risks associated with higher transaction amounts.&nbsp;&quot;To enable the ecosystem to respond efficiently to new use cases, it is proposed that NPCI, in consultation with banks and other stakeholders of the UPI ecosystem, may announce and revise such limits based on evolving user needs. Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to mitigate risks associated with higher limits. Banks shall continue to have the discretion to decide their own internal limits within the limits announced by NPCI,&quot; RBI said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;P2P transactions on UPI shall continue to be capped at Rs 1 lakh, as hitherto. NPCI will be advised accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Does This Mean for You?1. Larger transactions made easierFor most users, the Rs 1 lakh cap on UPI payments has not been an issue. But as digital transactions grow, so do the needs of businesses and individuals. Whether you&#39;re paying for a high-ticket item, making a bulk payment, or engaging in larger financial transactions, the move to increase UPI transaction limits means you&#39;ll be able to do more through the same simple and secure platform.&nbsp;For example, if you are running a small business or frequently making payments for goods or services worth more than \u20b91 lakh, this new flexibility could save you from the hassle of splitting payments into multiple transactions. With a revised limit, UPI could become an even more convenient tool for larger payments.&nbsp;&quot;Currently, P2P UPI payments are capped at \u20b91 lakh, and P2M payments at \u20b93-5 lakh. The RBI wants to revisit these limits to accommodate new use cases. UPI payments are now accepted in select countries abroad, so this may be one of the use cases. On the whole, on the retail side, UPI payments are actually getting smaller. While transactions have grown 33% February-on-February to 16 billion payments moving \u20b922 trillion for the month, the average UPI payment in February 2025 was \u20b91364 compared to \u20b91510 the previous February. This reveals that reliance on UPI for small-ticket payments is increasing,&quot; said Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com&nbsp;2. Security Measures to Keep You SafeWhile the transaction limits are set to increase, the RBI and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) have assured users that adequate safeguards will be in place to prevent fraud and mitigate risks. So, while you&#39;ll have the ability to make larger transactions, the security of your payments remains a top priority. These additional checks are designed to ensure that the growth in transaction limits does not compromise the safety and trust that users have come to expect from UPI.&nbsp;You can expect additional layers of verification for large transactions, which may include two-factor authentication or even biometrics, to add extra security.&nbsp;3. Bank-Specific Limits Still ApplyWhile NPCI will revise the overall transaction limits, each bank will still have the discretion to set its own internal limits. This means that while the system as a whole will be more flexible, your bank might have its own set of policies on how much you can transfer in a single UPI transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;4. P2P Transactions Remain UnchangedIf you regularly transfer money to friends, family, or colleagues, you&#39;ll still be bound by the Rs 1 lakh limit for Person-to-Person (P2P) transactions. The cap for P2P payments will remain unchanged for now, so smaller, day-to-day transfers are unaffected by this new rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["RBI MPC", "UPI", "UPI limit", "Home loans", "Fixed deposit", "FD interest rate", "RBI mpc meeting june 2023", "FD interest rate news", "fixed deposits rate", "RBI"], "date": "2025-04-09T13:50:15+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900571", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:56:13"},

HNW depositors can benefit from higher rates available on non-callable deposits,&rdquo; said Shetty.&nbsp;For those worried about inflation, he suggested keeping some exposure to equities. &ldquo;Senior citizens should use FDs for stable income, but must also allocate a portion of their portfolio into equities for inflation-adjusted returns,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Wider portfolio planning in a falling rate cycle&nbsp;Aman Gupta, director of RPS Group, said FD investors must be more active in tracking policy trends. &ldquo;Start with banks and NBFCs that offer the best rates&mdash;small finance banks tend to pay 0.5&ndash;1% higher than the more orthodox banks,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Gupta said tax treatment also plays a role. &ldquo;Post FD returns after the tax slab are not inflation-indexed; tax saving FDs or Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) outperform inflation post taxation and therefore are better alternatives,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;He also pointed to hybrid options. &ldquo;Channel a portion of the savings towards instruments such as arbitrage or conservative hybrid funds which offer better stability than equities but tend to be volatile relative to bonds,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;He added that investors should avoid defaulting to high-risk assets. &ldquo;Sustain an emergency cash fund of 6&ndash;12 months of expenses while alternatives are explored,&rdquo; Gupta said.&nbsp;Explore staggered investments&nbsp;Siddharth Maurya, founder and managing director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited, suggested breaking up FD investments across different tenures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Try out debt mutual funds, corporate bonds, or RBI floating rate savings bonds as they may yield superior returns after tax,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Employ FD laddering&mdash;divide your portfolio into several FDs with staggered maturities, for example, 1, 2 and 3 years.&rdquo;&nbsp;He also advised checking renewal dates. &ldquo;If you have shorter-term deposits, make sure to renew them reliably to bypass auto-renewal at devalued rates,&rdquo; said Maurya.&nbsp;&quot;Investors can also look for an option of corporate deposits like Shriram Finance Ltd, Mahindra Finance Ltd, Bajaj Finance Ltd, PNB Housing Finance Ltd which are offering higher rates than banks and can give 100 bps extra point which can matter alot while investing substantial amount,&quot; said&nbsp;Bharat Mundada, Director, Mundada Finserv Private Limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shetty also listed a few strategies to consider:&nbsp;Lock in current FD rates: Consider locking in funds now for medium to long-term tenures.&nbsp;Use laddering: Break up FDs into different maturity periods to manage reinvestment risk and maintain liquidity.&nbsp;Explore small savings schemes: Schemes like SCSS or POMIS can offer better yields for risk-averse investors.&nbsp;Look at AAA-rated corporate FDs and debt mutual funds: These may offer slightly higher returns, though with some market or credit risk.&nbsp;The cut in repo rate comes amid global economic shifts. It follows US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s reciprocal tariffs, including a 104 per cent levy on Chinese goods, which has unsettled international markets.&nbsp;Compiled by Bank Bazaar&nbsp;", "keywords": ["RBI repo rate cut", "FD rates falling", "HDFC Bank cuts rates", "SBI ends Amrit Kalash", "senior citizens get extra 0.5%", "use FD laddering", "try debt funds", "consider SCSS", "explore small finance banks", "avoid auto-renewals", "lock in current rates", "inflation risk rising", "Trump tariffs add pressure"], "date": "2025-04-09T11:05:30+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900318", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:56:16"},

These stocks were down up to 5 per cent on the BSE in intra-day trade.&nbsp;At 10:00 AM, the BSE 500 index, which accounts for 89 per cent of the BSE listed companies, was down 1.7 per cent, as compared to the 1 per cent decline in the BSE Sensex.&nbsp;&quot;The ongoing uncertainty surrounding US trade policies and tariffs, coupled with domestic economic growth concerns and persistent selling by FIIs, is dampening market sentiment,&rdquo; said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.&nbsp;The mid- and small-cap stocks experienced significant declines due to demand concerns and higher valuations. Although the Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s (RBI) intervention provided some recovery for the rupee from yesterday&#39;s record low, it remains under pressure and is likely to keep the market volatile in the near-term. Investors are anticipating the PM&rsquo;s visit to the US for any potential relief in trade uncertainty, while the US inflation data later today will also be a key focus, Nair added.&nbsp;Meanwhile, HSBC Global Research believes India&#39;s premium multiple valuations will remain under pressure until earnings stabilise. FYQ3 results were below estimates, even amid the backdrop of lowered expectations. Growth is likely to remain weak for at least two quarters before the lower base or potential policy impact kicks in, it noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We see downside risk to consensus&#39;s 15 per cent growth expectations in CY25. However, there are pockets of growth. The recent sell-off has created a good opportunity for companies with a strong or improving growth narrative,&rdquo; the brokerage firm said.&nbsp;Also Read: Error 404! 81% of Nifty 500 stocks dip below 200-DMA; market strategy here&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the individual stocks, the real estate company, DLF slipped 5 per cent to Rs 676.20, falling below its previous low of Rs 689.90 touched on June 4, 2024. The stock has corrected 30 per cent from its 52-week high level of Rs 677.80 touched on April 1, 2024.&nbsp;According to HSBC Global Research, real estate demand growth is expected to start pivoting towards mid-income housing. The past four years have been dominated by &quot;upgrade&quot; demand, serving developers well to achieve better pricing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past four years (2021-24), residential real estate pre-sales volumes and value increased by compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 18 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively. HSBC Global Research still expects growth in 2025 as 2024 was weaker on launches, but the high base will start impacting the pace of growth.&nbsp;However, if the approval cycle remains weak, companies may need to cut growth guidance for FY26e pre-sales to the high-single to low-double digits. From recent discussions, the brokerage firm said they feel investors are still focussed on pre-sales and, hence, any slowness could adversely impact the stock&#39;s performance.&nbsp;Shares of Jio Financial Services hit a 52-week low of Rs 223.60, slipping 5 per cent in intra-day trades today. The stock tanked 43 per cent from its 52-week high level of Rs 394.70, touched on April 23, 2024.&nbsp;In the past one month, the stock has declined 20 per cent after the company reported a flat consolidated profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 295 crore for the third quarter ended December 2024 (Q3FY25). The company had earned a consolidated net profit of Rs 294 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal (Q3FY24).&nbsp;While PAT remained relatively stable on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, it decreased by 57.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) due to the base effect. Net Interest Income (NII) for Q3FY25 was Rs 205 crore, marking a decline of 21.9 per cent YoY; though it saw a 2.5 per cent increase QoQ.&nbsp;Despite Jio Financial Services ramping up its operations and expanding its product portfolio to include mutual funds, insurance, and digital solutions, the company remains in a growth and scaling phase. With ongoing investments, regulatory approvals, and operational ramp-up efforts, it is challenging to accurately value or make precise earnings estimates at this stage. While the company&rsquo;s long-term prospects are promising, the volatility in earnings and the uncertain near-term outlook warrant a more cautious approach, according to analysts at KRChoksey Shares and Securities.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Reliance Industries", "RIL", "Share", "Market", "Asian Paints", "Power Grid Corporation", "Tata Motors", "52-week low stock", "BSE 100 index", "BSE 500 index", "BSE Sensex", "Coal India", "Canara Bank", "DLF", "GAIL (India)", "Hero MotoCorp", "Indian Oil Corporation", "Jio Financial Services", "REC", "Tube Investments of India"], "date": "2025-02-12T10:42:33+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021200400", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:56:20"},

Interim support during the week can be anticipated around 75,350 - 75,000 - 74,700 levels.&nbsp; On the upside, the 76,300 level is likely to act as an immediate resistance.

The notice, served last week, follows a plea by Tata Consumer-owned Capital Foods, which alleges trademark infringement, according to a report by Bar and Bench.&nbsp;The legal faceoff follows Tata Consumer&rsquo;s acquisition of Capital Foods in January 2024, aiming to broaden its product portfolio and penetrate high-margin categories in the FMCG sector.

The company accused Dabur of misleading consumers by adopting the same brand name and similar packaging, arguing that Dabur prominently displays &lsquo;Schezwan Chutney&rsquo; while its own brand name is less visible.&nbsp;Dabur launched its own Schezwan Chutney last year and has since contested the trademark registration at the Trademarks Registry.

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) benchmark was launched in July 1990, and since then there have been only two instances when the Nifty 50 index has registered consecutive net loss for five or more months.&nbsp; The present downtrend, which started from October 2024 till date shall be the third such instance. The Nifty thus far in February has declined 4 per cent, with just three trading sessions remaining this month. Overall, in the last five months, the Nifty has so far shed 12.6 per cent from levels of 25,811 at the end of September 2024.&nbsp; Amid the fall, one in every five Nifty stocks has declined more than 28 per cent thus far in the last 5 months. Trent, Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, BPCL, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Tata Motors are the major laggards, down in the range of 31 - 33 per cent.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Adani Green, Suzlon, Swan Energy: Stocks with biggest drop in PE ratio&nbsp; Among the index heavyweights, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), ITC and Reliance Industries have tanked 24 per cent, 22 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. There are only 4 gainers thus far in this period - Wipro, Bajaj Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank, up 6 - 9 per cent each.&nbsp; Why does the current market fall look worrisome?&nbsp; One of the key reasons to be worried about the current market fall is that despite the Nifty falling nearly 13 per cent from its peak, the net loss is fairly less compared to the average losses in the past instances wherein the NSE benchmark has registered a fall in four or more consecutive months.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Death Cross Alert: 5 stocks on the verge of crashing; check details&nbsp; Data from ACE Equity shows that the Nifty has registered a monthly losing streak of four or more months on five occasions in its 30-year history, excluding the present one.&nbsp; The average fall in the last five falls has been 26.8 per cent, which is more-than-double of what we have witnessed thus far in the current dip. The Nifty registered its biggest loss, down 31.4 during its longest monthly losing streak, spanning 8 months, in the period September 1994 - April 1995, data shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That apart, in the only other five-month losing streak - i.e. from July 1996 to November 1996 - the Nifty tumbled by 26 per cent. In fact, in each of the last five such instances, the minimum fall on the Nifty has been 21.8 per cent. Thus, historically speaking the current fall seems far lesser and the index could be vulnerable to a bigger fall given the present market dynamics.&nbsp; Worries galore&nbsp; The recent fall has been accentuated following Donald Trump&#39;s tariff threats, and its likely impact on global economies. Analysts believe the uncertainty surrounding this is likely to keep the market sentiment in check over the next few months.&nbsp; &quot;There is no clarity on what Donald Trump will do as regards tariffs and the geopolitical scenario. There are too many uncertainties and policy flip-flops. All this is impacting markets. Tariffs will have an impact on the US economy too, which will keep the US dollar in play. The US Fed, too, can at some point in time look at hiking rates. As a result, emerging markets will continue to feel the heat.&rdquo; said U R Bhat, co-founder & director, Alphaniti Fintech.&nbsp; That apart, fears of stagflation in the US economy and persistent foreign institutional investors (FIIs) selling weighs on the investor sentiment. FIIs have net sold stocks to the tune of Rs 1.3 trillion since the start of the year 2025 - marking it as the worst sell-off in any similar comparable period.&nbsp; ALSO READ: FIIs may not return to India soon; China remains a better bet: Analysts&nbsp; The recent steep rise in the US 5-year breakeven inflation rate to 2.61 per cent, a two-year high coupled with the unexpected contraction seen in the S&P Global flash US Services PMI for February has increased the odds of a stagflation environment, explains Kelvin Wong, Senior Market Analyst, OANDA.&nbsp; An increasingly less dovish monetary policy stance is likely to be adopted by the US Federal Reserve, in turn, tighten liquidity conditions that may trigger a medium-term negative feedback loop into the US stock market, Kelvin Wong said.&nbsp; Where can the Nifty bottom?&nbsp; Here&#39;s what happened in the past.&nbsp; Technical charts show that barring the June 2001 - September 2001 fall, the NSE Nifty 50 index has more-or-less bottomed out after testing its super trend line support on the monthly scale. During the July 1996 - November 1996&nbsp; five-month fall the Nifty bottomed out after testing the super trend line support; whereas in the May 1998 - August 1998 four-month fall, the Nifty briefly violated (by a margin of 2.5 per cent) the key trend line support and then rebounded.&nbsp; However, during the 2001 fall, the Nifty crashed below the lower-end of the Bollinger Bands on the monthly scale before bottoming out. The Nifty slid nearly 8 per cent below the lower-end of the monthly Bollinger Bands before bottoming out.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Can smallcap stocks crash trigger a capitulation phase? What analysts say&nbsp; At present, the super trend line support for the Nifty on the monthly scale stands at 21,515 - this implies a potential downside risk of 4.6 per cent from present levels. Below which stands the 50-MMA (Monthly Moving Average) at 19,150 levels, and the lower-end of the Bollinger Bands at 18,500 levels.&nbsp; For now, from a technical analysis standpoint, Nifty&#39;s support level at 22,500 - 22,400 has become increasingly critical for the Nifty 50 index in the immediate future, said Osho Krishnan, senior analyst for technical & derivatives research at Angel One.&nbsp; &quot;This level needs to be scrutinized by traders and investors, as its ability to hold may determine whether a rebound is possible or if further declines are on the horizon. The presence of a bearish gap at 22,670 - 22,720 casts a shadow over any potential recovery attempts. This gap is expected to present a significant barrier to upward price movement, acting as a stiff resistance point that could limit Nifty&#39;s ability to regain its momentum,&quot; Krishnan added.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["stock market", "market outlook", "nifty 50 index", "NSE Nifty", "Nifty fall", "nifty losers", "nifty 50 stocks", "adani enterprises", "trent", "stock market fall", "stock market crash", "biggest stock market fall", "market fall 2025", "nifty worst fall", "indian equity markets", "market trends", "Nifty outlook 2025", "Nifty 2025 outlook", "Nifty stocks outlook", "Nifty stocks 2025"], "date": "2025-02-25T22:50:53+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022500254", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:56:34"},

Appeal is dismissed,&quot; said NCLAT.However, NCLAT further said it shall be open for Narayana to pursue other remedies as available in law.Earlier, both HUL and the petitioner had a running account between them and invoices relate to the period from 2008 to 2018.Narayana submitted that as an operational creditor, he was entitled to charge 24 per cent interest and if the interest is added to the principal amount of Rs 59 lakh, it would be more than Rs 1 crore.He also claimed that the operational creditor is an MSME.However, this was also rejected by NCLAT which said:&quot;The submission of the appellant that he is entitled to charging 24 per cent interest is not supported by any Purchase Order or any other material on the record. The claim of the appellant that it is an MSME, therefore, it is entitled to charge 24 per cent interest cannot be accepted.&quot;&nbsp;The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) mandates the minimum limit of default to be Rs 1 crore for initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).Moreover, under IBC, the limitation period for filing an application to initiate insolvency proceedings is generally three years from the date of default.", "keywords": ["NCLAT", "insolvency proceedings", "HUL", "operational creditor", "NCLT", "IBC", "Lalithambica Enterprises", "pre-existing dispute", "legal notice", "Section 9", "arbitration", "MSME", "invoice dispute", "corporate insolvency resolution process", "appeal dismissed", "interest charges", "financial dispute", "insolvency case", "MSME interest claim", "tribunal ruling", "Mumbai NCLT"], "date": "2025-01-27T20:05:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125012701143", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:56:34"},

Negative pricing happens when supply is too high relative to demand.In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the company reported a PAT of Rs 2,668 crore, as per brokerages tracked by Business Standard.Further, analysts expect the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company&#39;s revenue to grow 4.2 per cent on an average to Rs 15,659.13 crore as compared to Rs 15,027 crore year-on-year (Y-o-Y).&nbsp; The growth in cigarette, FMCG, hotels, and agri revenue is likely to boost revenue.Similarly, its Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) is likely to remain flat at Rs 3,698.7 crore on average as compared to Rs 3,694 crore a year ago. Analysts expect the discontinuation of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare&#39;s distribution agreement for over-the-counter (OTC) products on November 8, 2023, to put pressure on operating income.Similarly, HUL&#39;s Ebitda margin is also estimated to remain flat owing to higher ad-spends, higher royalty payment, and GlaxoSmithKline&#39;s (GSK) consignment sales termination. Margins for the quarter under review are estimated in the range of 23.4 to 24 per cent as against 24.6 in the corresponding month of the previous year.Additionally, consumer response to the new formulation of Lux and Lifebuoy, competitive advantage, demand outlook on rural and urban, competitive intensity, and raw material trends will be on analysts&#39; radar.The company is set to announce its Q2FY25 numbers on Wednesday, October 23.Here&rsquo;s what brokerages expect from HUL&#39;s Q2 results:Axis Securities: Analysts at Axis expect the revenue of HUL to grow 4 per cent Y-o-Y as rural demand is outpacing urban. They peg the revenue for the September quarter at Rs 15,621 crore as against Rs 15,027 crore a year ago.Meanwhile, they expect Ebitda margins at 24 per cent as compared to 24.6 per cent a year ago.Kotak Institutional Equities: The brokerage expects a 5 per cent Y-o-Y growth in Underlying Volume Growth (UVG) against 4 per cent/2 per cent in 1QFY25/2QFY24.Further, Kotak analysts expect HUL&#39;s home care business to grow by 5.3 per cent Y-o-Y, beauty and personal care revenue to grow by 3 per cent Y-o-Y aided by an uptick in personal wash, and the food & refreshment segment to grow by 4.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q).Nuvama Institutional Equities: Nuvama analysts anticipate demand recovery to be gradual for HUL as negative pricing is likely to reverse in H2FY25.Additionally, as per them, the base quarter included a one-off credit from the resolution of tax litigation will benefit both revenue by 1 per cent and PAT by 4 per cent.In Q2FY25, the brokerage reckons the company&#39;s standalone revenue to grow 4 per cent Y-o-Y. Analysts at Nuvama peg revenue for the second quarter at Rs 1,5628 crore.Meanwhile, they expect pricing cuts to be by 1 per cent, lower than 2.5 per cent in Q1.As per Nuvama, in palm oil, some inflation was seen, but HUL is benefiting due to its new formulation in two brands. Meanwhile, other commodity costs remain benign.

In two days, the stock of the jewellery company has surged 6 per cent. In comparison, the BSE Sensex was down 0.54 per cent at 79,513.27 at 10:23 AM.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s profitability for the September quarter (Q2FY25) was quite depressed on account of the customs duty related losses, as well as the need to invest in the growth of various businesses. However the company&#39;s management had said they are quite confident about the competitiveness of each of the company&rsquo;s businesses and remain optimistic about the performance for the rest of the financial year.&nbsp;In the previous calendar year 2024 (CY24), Titan had underperformed the market, and recorded negative returns for the first time&nbsp;in the past eight years. In CY24, the stock fell 11 per cent, as compared to a 9 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex.&nbsp;During Q3FY25, the market price of Titan had slipped 15 per cent as the company reported a weak set of numbers, with profit after tax declining 23.1 per cent year-on-year (YoY) at Rs 704 crore for the quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) margin contracted 416 bps to 8.7 per cent. The company reported a 25 per cent YoY growth in its domestic&nbsp;jewellery operations after a relatively soft June quarter (Q1FY25).&nbsp;&nbsp;Titan said consumer demand significantly picked up momentum after the reduction in custom duty on gold imports, to 6 per cent&nbsp;from 15 per cent earlier, leading to a strong double-digit uptick in gold (plain) for the quarter. The non-solitaire studded segment recorded growth in high double-digits, whereas the solitaire segment saw a decline amidst price uncertainty and demand supply dynamics in the international markets, both together resulting in overall studded sales growth of low double-digits for the quarter.&nbsp;The company&#39;s H2 margins are expected to be better than H1, aided by good demand and a better mix. Titan&#39;s management has guided for 11-11.5 per cent normalised consolidated margins for the jewellery business in FY2025. It further indicated that festive demand has been excellent, and wedding demand has picked up and is expected to maintain momentum for the next 1-2 quarters. Demand for non-solitaire and smaller size solitaire in studded jewellery is good, while demand for large solitaire stones is impacted by a price correction.&nbsp;Titan&#39;s diversified portfolio of jewellery, watches, and eyecare businesses has demonstrated a strong revenue growth, driven by robust demand for studded jewelry, analog watches, and eye care products. However, margins were under pressure and the management also lowered its EBIT margin forecast for FY25. With a solid foundation for growth established, Titan&#39;s focus on product innovation, retailing, branding, and premiumisation is likely to continue driving growth in its core businesses, analysts at Geojit Financial Services said in the company&#39;s Q2 results update.&nbsp;Mirae Asset Sharekhan said Titan&rsquo;s Q2FY2025 performance was impacted by lower margins in the jewellery business. Double-digit revenue growth momentum is likely to continue in the coming quarters driven by growth across businesses. A strong growth outlook, focus on sustained market share gains, and a strong balance sheet make Titan the best play in the discretionary space. The pressure on margins is short-term and the management expects an uptick in margins in the medium-term, the brokerage firm said in the result update.&nbsp;Despite near-term margin headwinds, the company is confident of maintaining good growth momentum in the quarters ahead, led by market share gains, network expansion, and a shift to trusted brands. The company aims to achieve consistent double-digit revenue growth over the next five years by strengthening its core businesses such as watches, jewellery, and eyecare through efficient capital allocation.

Consumer preferences were firmly oriented towards higher-end timepieces, particularly evident in the growths of Titan, Edge and Xylys and international brands through the Helios channel, Titan said.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Titan&rsquo;s profitability for the September quarter (Q2FY25) was quite depressed on account of the customs duty related losses, as well as the need to invest in the growth of various businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The company&#39;s management had indicated a good festive season demand and a pick-up in jewellery sales prior to the wedding season.

Jewellery business is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent over FY24-27, according to analysts at ICICI Securities.&nbsp;With good traction in the analog watches segment since the past few quarters backed by design innovation, premiumisation and better execution, Titan&#39;s watches business is expected to grow in double digit.

The roll-out started last month.&nbsp;&quot;You get an increase in natural GLP-1 which helps in controlling the feeling of hunger.

The decision to lend is solely dependent on the bank and CIBIL does not in any manner decide if the loan/credit card should be sanctioned or not.Your CIBIL score, calculated based on your credit behaviour as reflected in the &lsquo;Accounts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Enquiries&rsquo; section of your CIR, ranges between 300-900. A score above 700 is generally considered good.&nbsp; The closer your score is to 900, the better your credit rating is.How SBI has distributed discount per cent based on the Cibil score:&nbsp;101-150 CIBIL score: For those who come under this range, the bank is not offering any discount, the effective home loan interest rate is 9.45 per cent.151-200 CIBIL score: SBI is offering a discount of 65 bps during the offer period and the effective rate in the period stands at 8.7 per cent.550-599 CIBIL score: The bank is not offering any discount at this score. The effective rate is 9.45 per cent and 9.65 per cent.700-749 CIBIL score: SBI is offering a discount of 65 bps during the offer period and the effective rate is 8.7 per cent.750-800 CIBIL score: For CIBIL score ranging between 750-800 and above, the home loan interest during the offer period is 8.60 per cent with a concession of 55 bps.In addition to these concessions, one with a CIBIL score of 700 and above can also get a bps discount in case of home loan takeovers, resale and ready-to-move properties. For builder tie-up projects, a 5 bps additional concession is offered over the above-proposed rates.For Shaurya, Shaurya Flexi and Shaurya Flexi Vishisht Products, SBI is offering an additional concession of 10 bps over the above campaign rates during the offer period.The above campaign rates are inclusive of interest concessions available to women borrowers and concessions available at the product level (i.e..

With the advent of technology and changing work dynamics, the traditional nine-to-five office model has given way to remote and hybrid work environments. While these flexible setups offer numerous benefits, they also introduce unique security challenges. This article delves into the innovative solutions and best practices that organisations can adopt to uphold security standards in the modern workplace.The evolution of work environmentsThe rise of remote and hybrid work has provided employees with unprecedented flexibility. Individuals can now work from various locations, access company resources remotely, and collaborate across geographical boundaries. However, this flexibility comes with its own set of security concerns, as it opens up new avenues for cyber threats and data breaches.Best practices for securing remote and hybrid work environmentsStrong authentication measures: Employing multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an effective way to bolster security. MFA requires users to provide two or more authentication factors before gaining access, adding an extra layer of protection beyond passwords.Secure connection protocols: The use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) when accessing company resources remotely should be encouraged. VPNs encrypt the data transmitted between the user and the company&#39;s network, making it significantly harder for hackers to intercept sensitive information.Device management: Establish a device management policy that outlines the security standards for both company-owned and personal devices used for work purposes. Implementing remote wipe capabilities for lost or stolen devices can prevent unauthorised access to company data.Regular software updates: Ensure that all devices and software are regularly updated with the latest security patches. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities, so keeping systems up to date is essential for mitigating risks.Data encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data. This means that even if data is intercepted during transmission, it remains unreadable without the encryption keys.User training: Educate employees about potential security risks, such as phishing attacks and social engineering. By raising awareness and providing guidelines on identifying suspicious activities, organisations can empower their workforce to be the first line of defence.Innovative solutions for hybrid work environmentsZero trust architecture: Zero Trust is a security framework that treats every user and device as potentially untrusted, regardless of their location. It enforces strict access controls and continuously verifies the identity of users and devices before granting access to resources.Endpoint detection and response (EDR): EDR solutions provide real-time monitoring of endpoints, such as laptops and mobile devices, for signs of malicious activity. This proactive approach enables organisations to respond swiftly to any potential threats.Cloud security measures: For organisations that rely on cloud services, implementing robust cloud security measures is crucial. This includes encrypting data stored in the cloud, monitoring access logs, and configuring proper access controls.Behavioural analytics: By using behavioural analytics organisations can identify deviations from normal user behaviour that may indicate a security breach. This advanced technology helps detect insider threats and anomalies in real time.Balancing security and flexibilityAs the workplace continues to evolve, striking the right balance between security and flexibility becomes paramount. While robust security measures are essential, they should not hinder productivity or create unnecessary barriers for employees. Organisations must implement solutions that seamlessly integrate security into daily workflows without causing disruption.In today&#39;s remote and hybrid work environments, securing company assets and sensitive information requires a multifaceted approach. From strong authentication measures to innovative solutions like Zero Trust architecture and behavioural analytics, organisations have an array of tools at their disposal. The key is to remain proactive, adapt to emerging threats, and foster a security-conscious culture among employees. By implementing these best practices, businesses can navigate the modern workplace landscape while keeping security uncompromised.", "keywords": ["hybrid environments"], "date": "2023-09-07T13:39:58+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "123090600614", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:57:01"},

Businesses rely heavily on technology to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and drive innovation. However, with these technological advances come potential vulnerabilities that malicious actors seek to exploit. This article delves into the fundamental principles and practices that serve as the cornerstone of a comprehensive enterprise security strategy.Before delving into the intricacies of enterprise security, it&#39;s crucial to grasp the complex landscape in which modern businesses operate. Cyberattacks have grown in sophistication, ranging from malware and phishing attacks to ransomware and data breaches. These threats can lead to severe consequences, including financial loss, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and compromised customer trust.Principles of enterprise securityRisk assessment: A strong security foundation begins with a thorough risk assessment. This involves identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the possible impact of an attack on various aspects of the business. A tailored security strategy can then be developed based on these findings.Access control: Restricting access to sensitive data and critical systems is a pivotal aspect of enterprise security. Implementing strict access controls ensures that only authorised personnel can access specific information, reducing the risk of unauthorised breaches.Data encryption: Encrypting data is akin to placing it in a secure vault. By converting sensitive information into unreadable code means that the data remains unintelligible without encryption keys even if attackers gain access.Regular updates and patch management: Cyber attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities in software and systems. Regular updates and patch management are essential to fix these vulnerabilities and keep the digital infrastructure robust and secure.Employee training: Human error remains a significant factor in security breaches. By educating employees about cybersecurity best practices, how to identify potential threats, and the importance of strong password hygiene, businesses can significantly mitigate risks.Foundational security practicesFirewalls and intrusion detection systems: Firewalls act as digital gatekeepers, controlling the flow of data between networks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activities, alerting administrators to potential breaches.Multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA is an extra layer of security that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification before gaining access. This can include passwords, biometrics, or even physical tokens.Security audits and penetration testing: Regular security audits and penetration testing help identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors do these. Ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks to pinpoint weaknesses and suggest remedial actions.Incident response plan: Despite preventive measures, breaches may occur. An incident response plan outlines the steps to take in the event of a security breach, ensuring a swift and coordinated response to mitigate damage and reduce downtime.Backup and recovery: Regular data backups are a safety net against catastrophic data loss. These backups should be stored securely and tested periodically to ensure they are functional when needed.As technology continues to advance, so does the sophistication of cyber threats. Building a strong foundation for enterprise security is an ongoing commitment that demands vigilance, adaptability, and a proactive approach. Staying updated on emerging threats and consistently reassessing security measures is essential to maintain a robust security posture.The foundation of a formidable enterprise security strategy lies in comprehending the evolving threat landscape, adhering to core security principles, and implementing foundational security practices. By conducting thorough risk assessments, controlling access, encrypting data, providing employee training, and utilising tools like firewalls and MFA, organisations can significantly bolster their security defences. In this dynamic digital era, safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring business continuity, and nurturing customer trust require a steadfast commitment to enterprise security.", "keywords": ["enterprise security"], "date": "2023-09-07T13:26:58+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "123090600587", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:57:01"},

Losing a critical document like car insurance can create many roadblocks when filing claims, renewing policies, or presenting proof during official inspections. As per the Motor Vehicle, (Amendment) Bill 2016, it is mandatory for every four-wheeler owner to keep a valid and up-to-date insurance policy document. Being non-compliant with this can result in legal issues that can lead to a penalty of Rs2,000 or more.

From individuals to multinational corporations, the threat landscape encompasses a diverse array of cyber risks, including phishing attacks, ransomware incidents, and data breaches. Safeguarding against these threats requires a comprehensive strategy that combines proactive identification and decisive mitigation.&nbsp;Before diving into defence strategies, it&#39;s essential to recognise the multifaceted nature of the cyber threat landscape. Cybercriminals employ a variety of tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems and extract valuable information for financial gain or malicious intent. From deceptive phishing emails to sophisticated ransomware attacks, the arsenal of cyber threats is both diverse and evolving.Phishing attack mitigationPhishing attacks involve tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, often through deceptive emails. To defend against such attacks, organisations and individuals should:Educate users: Provide regular training to raise awareness about phishing tactics and encourage cautious behaviour while handling emails from unknown sources.Email filtering: Employ advanced email-filtering tools that can detect and quarantine suspicious emails before they reach users&#39; inboxes.Verification protocols: Encourage users to verify requests for sensitive information through secondary communication channels before responding.Ransomware defenceRansomware attacks encrypt vital data, demanding payment for its release. Effective strategies to combat ransomware include:Regular backups: Maintain regular and secure backups of critical data to ensure that it can be restored without paying a ransom.Security patches: Keep software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.Segmentation: Isolate critical systems from less critical ones to limit the spread of ransomware within the network.Data breach preventionData breaches can expose sensitive information to malicious actors. Preventive measures include:Data encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and during transmission to render it useless to unauthorised users.Access control: Implement strong access controls to restrict data access only to those who need it for their roles.Monitoring: Deploy advanced monitoring tools to detect suspicious activities and unauthorised access attempts promptly.Malware defenceMalware can infiltrate systems and steal data or disrupt operations. Defence strategies involve:Antivirus software: Install trusted antivirus software to detect and remove malware from systems.User education: Educate users about the risks of downloading attachments or clicking on links from unknown sources.Network segmentation: Divide the network into segments to contain malware and limit its spread.Incident response planningPreparing for potential incidents is essential. Key steps include:Response teams: Establish dedicated teams responsible for handling cybersecurity incidents promptly and effectively.Playbooks: Develop incident response playbooks that outline the steps to take during various types of cyber incidents.Communication protocols: Establish clear communication channels to keep stakeholders informed about incident response progress.In the face of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, defending against cyber threats demands constant vigilance and adaptation. Organisations and individuals must stay up to date with emerging threats and refine their defence strategies accordingly. The collaboration of technology, education, and proactive planning forms the foundation of a robust cyber defence.Countering cyber threats necessitates a multi-pronged approach that encompasses diverse strategies. From thwarting phishing attacks to mitigating the impact of ransomware incidents, the key lies in educating users, implementing advanced security measures, and preparing for effective incident response. In this age of digital interconnectedness, safeguarding against cyber threats is not just a responsibility but a crucial imperative to protect sensitive information, preserve operational integrity, and maintain trust in digital interactions.", "keywords": ["cyber threats"], "date": "2023-09-07T13:35:04+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "123090600597", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:57:01"},

It was provided by India to Bangladesh in June 2020.&quot;It has been decided to rescind... circular...dated June 29, 2020, as amended with immediate effect. Cargo already entered into India may be allowed to exit the Indian territory as per the procedure given in that circular,&quot; the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs&#39; circular, dated April 8, said.The announcement comes at a time when the US has imposed sweeping tariffs against a number of countries, including India and Bangladesh.The earlier circular had allowed transshipment of export cargo from Bangladesh to third countries using Indian Land Customs Stations (LCSs) en route to Indian ports and airports.According to trade experts, the decision will help many of the Indian exporting sectors like apparel, footwear, and gems and jewellery.Bangladesh is a big competitor of India in the textile sector.&quot;Now we will have more air capacity for our cargo. In the past, exporters have complained about lesser space due to the transhipment facility given to Bangladesh,&quot; Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai said.Apparel exporters&#39; body AEPC had earlier urged the government to suspend this order, which allows the trans-shipment of Bangladesh export cargo to third countries through the Delhi air cargo complex.AEPC Chairman Sudhir Sekhri had stated that almost 20-30 loaded trucks arrive in Delhi every day, which slows down the smooth movement of cargo, and airlines are taking undue advantage of this.This leads to an excessive increase in air freight rates, delay in handling and processing of export cargo, and severe congestion at the Cargo Terminal at the IGI Airport, Delhi, resulting in exports of Indian apparel through the Delhi air cargo complex becoming uncompetitive.&quot;This will help in rationalization of freight rates resulting in less transportation cost to the Indian exporters besides decongesting the airports leading to the shorter transit time to ship the goods,&quot; AEPC Secretary General Mithileshwar Thakur said.Think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Founder Ajay Srivastava said that the withdrawal of this facility is expected to disrupt Bangladesh&#39;s export and import logistics, which depend on Indian infrastructure for third-country trade.&quot;The previous mechanism had offered a streamlined route through India, cutting transit time and cost. Now, without it, Bangladeshi exporters may face logistical delays, higher costs, and uncertainty. Additionally, Nepal and Bhutan, both landlocked nations, may raise concerns about restricted transit access to Bangladesh, especially as this move will hamper their trade with Bangladesh,&quot; Srivastava said.He added that Bangladesh&#39;s plans for creating strategic base near Chicken&#39;s Neck area with China&#39;s help may have prompted this action.On the other hand, India always supported Bangladesh cause. India allows one way zero tariff access to Bangladesh goods (all except alcohol and cigarettes) to vast India market since past two decades.India-Bangladesh relations nosedived dramatically after the interim government headed by Muhammad failed to contain attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in that country.The India-Bangladesh trade stood at USD 12.9 billion in 2023-24.", "keywords": ["Economic globalization", "Freight transport", "Merchant navy", "Customs", "Delhi Air Cargo complex", "Geneva", "World Trade Organisation", "Sudhir Sekhri", "Cargo Terminal", "Ajay Sahai", "Nepal", "Delhi", "Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs", "Bangladesh", "Chairman", "Indirect Taxes", "IGI Airport", "Director General", "United States", "India", "Ajay Srivastava", "Myanmar", "Bhutan", "Federation of Indian Export Organisations", "AEPC"], "date": "2025-04-09T12:35:46+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900272", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:57:01"},

It&#39;s a model change. If the whole world had operated with tariffs between countries all the time, then the whole supply chain would not have gotten globally integrated,&rdquo; he said, adding that the problem is the global supply chain has got integrated.&nbsp;&ldquo;Very aptly, in globalisation, basically you produce where it is cheap or where it is efficient, and you sell where there is a demand. So, that&#39;s a by-product of the model that the world got used to for so long,&rdquo; Chandrasekaran said. &ldquo;Now, if you change the model, the underlying supply chain infrastructure has to change and that can&#39;t change overnight because there is talent issue, raw material and sourcing issues. There are so many things. That is going to be the fundamental problem. I think it will play out. It&#39;s not going to get solved overnight,&rdquo; he said, adding that the tariffs are not going back to zero.&nbsp;&ldquo;I personally believe that it&#39;s not going to go back to zero because when something is announced, some part of it will stay. So, where it settles, whether it settles uniformly across countries or it all gets solved bilaterally, only time will tell,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;Against this backdrop, Chandra said India is well-placed economically, and there will be demand for all products, be it healthcare, infrastructure, hotels, or education, in the years to come. &ldquo;There is a lot of demand and this will go on for a long time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;On artificial intelligence (AI) and the future of jobs, Chandra said routine jobs will get automated. &ldquo;But that doesn&#39;t mean all jobs will disappear. It just means the nature of work is evolving. I&rsquo;ve painted a very optimistic picture, and I genuinely believe it&rsquo;s a realistic one. Some people think AI will take over and leave no jobs behind, but I believe that&rsquo;s a misguided perspective,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;On working hours, Chandra said that will depend on the nature of the assignment. &ldquo;We often talk in general terms about work hours &mdash; whether we&rsquo;ll have 40-hour weeks, 70-hour weeks, or even 90-hour weeks &mdash; but that&rsquo;s not really how things work in practice. For many people, myself included, work isn&rsquo;t confined to strict hours. It&rsquo;s more like being switched on all the time, 24x7, not in a stressful way, but in a natural rhythm. I sleep well, I rest, I run, but my mind is always ready to switch back into work mode when needed. That&rsquo;s how it is when you truly enjoy what you do,&rdquo; Chandra said.&nbsp;The Tata group chairman added: &ldquo;Take investment bankers, for example. When there&rsquo;s a deal happening, they might not go home for days. But once it&#39;s done, they might take a week off, just relaxing, meeting friends for coffee or a glass of wine.

This is a win-win for both sides,&quot; Barakat Ahmed said.He said Indian companies must be more proactive.&quot;We&#39;ve seen a lot of interest from Indian private players recently--four companies approached us just last month. However many are still hesitant due to lack of on-ground clarity and perceived risks. That&#39;s where the ISA comes in--to de-risk the investment environment and facilitate partnerships,&quot; the official said.There is immense opportunity for Indian businesses as ISA is in discussions with seven to ten African countries to roll out large-scale solar installations ranging from USD 50 million to 400 million.These include countries such as Ethiopia, Guinea, Mauritius, Zambia, Niger and Mali.&quot;Africa remains the most underserved region in terms of energy access--with over 600 million people still lacking electricity. The nature of the continent&#39;s geography makes it impractical to rely solely on grid-based solutions, making solar energy the most viable and scalable option,&quot; Ahmed told ANI, adding that decentralized solar systems like rooftop panels and solar home kits offer a lifeline to millions.Ahmed is in Mauritius as ISA is holding Solar X Accelerator workshop, where 35 young Entrepreneurs from various parts of the world in the solar energy sector are receiving advanced training.While ISA now has 123 member countries, engagement in Africa has accelerated especially over the past two to three years. &quot;Out of 46 African member countries, 38 are now actively engaged with ISA, and 20 of those joined just last year,&quot; the official said, noting that the increase reflects growing awareness and trust in ISA&#39;s efforts.Despite this progress, challenges remain--especially around funding, technical capacity, and policy infrastructure. Officials highlighted that many African countries still lack the regulatory frameworks needed to attract private investors and manage long-term solar projects. &quot;We are working with governments to build capacity, help design policies, and prepare bankable projects. Without these foundations, even projects with high potential cannot attract financing,&quot; the official explained.ISA is currently helping countries like Uganda, Djibouti and Nigeria draft or review solar energy policies and regulatory mechanisms.The Alliance is also rolling out training and awareness programs to address the lack of skilled technicians and public understanding of solar solutions. One of its flagship initiatives, the STAR-C (Solar Technology Application Resource-Centres), has already been set up in seven African countries and will expand to ten this year, the official informed.These centres train government officials, engineers, and private sector players, ensuring long-term sustainability of solar projects.ISA is also working with African nations on a new vision aimed at accelerating solar adoption over the next 3-5 years.This includes aligning with Africa Union&#39;s &quot;continental master plan&quot; to build cross-border transmission infrastructure and enable electricity trading between countries.

Therefore, we need some support from the government,&rdquo; an exporter said.&nbsp;Since the interest equalisation scheme (IES) has not been operational from the beginning of the year, exporters urged the minister to restart the scheme at the earliest with an interest subvention of 5 per cent. They also asked to extend export boosting schemes such as Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) and Rebate of State and Central Levies and Taxes (RoSCTL) beyond September.&nbsp;Since some American buyers have put orders on hold, it has resulted in additional cost for exporters to maintain the inventory. &ldquo;We have requested some soft lending from the banks.

Potential reasons for ineffectiveness include:* Lack of technology and investment-Only 36% strongly agree that their organization's financial crime compliance program is sufficient in these respects.* Weak governance-40% strongly agree that their organization has a robust governance infrastructure for overseeing financial crime.Cybersecurity (76%) and the increased use of AI by criminals (72%) are the leading catalysts for risk exposure in the coming year--cited nearly twice as often as other factors, including:Increased incidence of predicate crimes (44%), financial pressure on individuals (48%), impact of remote working/decentralized management (44%) and slow technology implementation by financial compliance program (44%).As adoption of AI and machine learning advances, only 32% of respondents now exploring these tools see a \"very positive impact\" on their financial crime compliance frameworks.68% believe AI developments will benefit their financial crime compliance programs, while 52% agree AI poses a significant risk to compliance.Fifty-six percent say the financial crime threat posed by cryptocurrencies is a moderate to significant concern in the coming year.28% say their organization's financial crime compliance program caters to risk associated with cryptocurrencies; 28% are planning to do so in the future.A little over one-third of respondents say their financial crime compliance programs are \"very prepared\" to address geopolitical issues over the next 12 months, with the evolving sanctions landscape as one likely driver.Almost 5 in 10 respondents have high confidence in their program's sanction-screening capabilities.Fewer than 5 in 10 are very confident in their financial crime compliance program's ability to evaluate supply chain threats.The most prominent threats relate to cybersecurity (64%) and political instability (44%); 40 % respondents say their financial compliance program is \"very prepared\" to handle such threats in the coming year.Cybersecurity leads the charge in risk exposureCybersecurity threats have been a growing trend in recent years, and the data shows that concern is on the rise and the perception of AI in financial crime compliance is shifting.Over two-thirds (68%) of financial services professionals who expect financial crime risk to increase in the year ahead identify cybersecurity as the biggest driver of exposure and nearly half of organizations (49%) expect to invest in AI solutions as part of their efforts to tackle financial crime.However, just one-fifth (20%) of respondents believe AI has had a \"very positive\" effect on their financial crime compliance framework - down from 37% in 2023.Over a quarter (27%) of organizations have AI and machine learning as an established part of their financial crime compliance programs, exceeding 2023 levels (24%).AI is primarily being used to identify suspicious behavior (63%), followed by network analysis (54%) and identifying risk signals (44%), as firms seek to enhance detection capabilities.Evolving regulation raising concernsFinancial and professional services firms are preparing for greater enforcement action on regulations and evolving compliance challenges in 2025 - but a significant portion lack confidence in their ability to adapt, particularly with sanctions.Over half (55%) of respondents expect enforcement action against financial crime to increase and nearly two thirds (59%) see corporate transparency requirements changing within the next year.Nearly half of respondents (49%) say keeping up with regulatory changes is the biggest challenge in sanctions compliance, up from one-third (34%) in 2023.Globally, just under two in five (39%) senior financial professionals say that they are \"very confident\" in their organization's sanctions screening capabilities, with the U.K. (34%) trailing the global average.While 37% of organizations screen entirely in-house, using a third party (34%) and hybrid approach (28%) are becoming increasingly common.Geopolitical risks are high on the agenda2024 was a year of notable geopolitical events and 2025 has already begun with arguably more disruption than was seen through last year. Indeed, organizations are factoring this into their ongoing compliance efforts.Looking ahead through 2025, just one-third (33%) of respondents say that they are \"very prepared\" to address geopolitical risks over the next 12 months and only 38% are \"very confident\" in their financial compliance program's ability to detect emerging geopolitical threats.Among those who were less than \"very confident\" in their program's ability to assess their supply chains for threats, more than half (56%) of global respondents identified cybercrime as the biggest challenge to their programs in 2025. This was followed by political instability (35%) and geopolitical risk (26%).Tarun Bhatia, Regional Managing Director and Co-Head APAC Investigations Diligence and Compliance at Kroll, said, \"From cybersecurity threats to geopolitical uncertainty, firms in 2025 are facing an incredibly complex risk environment. The changing nature of risk analysis means that businesses are expected to stay abreast of a variety of risk factors, but this becomes increasingly difficult, the faster that illicit actors develop new tricks and tools. From an India perspective, it is worrying that while almost all respondents (96%) expect financial crime risk to increase in 2025, only one out of three believe that their organization's financial crime compliance program is\" very effective\". Lack of technology investment and weak governance have been identified as the main reasons for heightened risks and the onus is on the boards and senior management to strengthen the governance framework.\"Vicky Gala, Associate Managing Director, Investigations Diligence and Compliance at Kroll, says, \"The Indian government and regulators are taking multiple measures to ensure that relevant guidelines are suitably updated by bringing in amendments and new regulations to address challenges posed on account of increased dependence on technology. The overall impact of AI is yet to be fully understood, and the risk professionals are unsure about the benefits with almost half the respondents in India (52%) indicating that AI poses a significant risk to compliance. AML and Compliance professionals will need to be on top of their game, with the best tools, people and platforms, if they are to protect and grow their businesses.\"(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by PNN.

Indian business schools have a long history of generating highly competent graduates who are sought after by major global firms, making them a popular alternative to their South Asian counterparts. The attractiveness of Indian B-schools for students who aspire to flourish in the global business scene is bolstered by the existence of prestigious international collaborations, strong infrastructure, and a competitive academic environment.&rdquo;Indian B-schools are embracing a global outlook, recognising the importance of preparing students to thrive in a connected and interdependent world.

But why? &quot;The turning point when I decided to pursue an MBA was my realisation that I needed to understand analytics. While working as an assignment editor for the India team at MSN, I noticed that content was published on the website based on click-through rate (CTR) and traffic. We were required to meet targets by producing content that generated traffic. That&#39;s when I decided to learn something that would help me comprehend analytics for a better future.&quot;According to a Fortune India report, in 2022, as many as 403,202 students enrolled at about 3,100 institutions offering postgraduate diplomas in management (PGDM) and MBA programmes. There had been 435,000 enrolments at 3,112 B-schools the previous year. These numbers had increased significantly in 2021 after five continuous years of decline. In 2015, there had been 456,000 students at 3,608 institutions. The number of Common Admission Test (CAT) applications decreased from 244,000 in 2019 to 227,000 in 2020, but rose to 232,000 in 2021.In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), these numbers clearly emphasise the relevance and impact of an MBA tag on career growth trajectory. The long-term advantages of an MBA course, including financial and career opportunities, outweigh the immediate financial and time costs associated with the degree programme.While AI rapidly transforms various industries and business functions, it does not replace the need for business acumen, strategic thinking, and leadership skills, which are areas often emphasised in MBA programmes. AI is a powerful technology with the potential to disrupt and reshape industries. An MBA course equips professionals with the knowledge and skills to comprehend the strategic implications of AI, identify opportunities for its implementation, and manage its impact on organisations.Many recruiters count an MBA degree as an asset due to the skills that the degree holders usually possess. The programme also provides networking opportunities and business contacts through career placement cells, classmates, and programme faculty. While an MBA in finance remains a popular choice, MBA degrees in HR, IT and marketing are the next most sought after.Dr Balakrishna Grandhi, dean, Global MBA & MGB, and professor of marketing & strategy at SP Jain School of Global Management, said: &quot;There has been a tectonic change in the macro business environment in the recent past &mdash; be it due to the pandemic, supply-chain disruptions, the Ukraine-Russia conflict, shortage of chips, volatility in commodity prices, emerging technologies, explosion of data, global warming, unprecedented inflation, shifts in shopping behaviour, climate change, and more. Every company is forced to reinvent its business model, bringing people with skills to help adapt to the macro turbulence, and to add value by designing and executing customer-centric strategies and processes, not just for survival but also growth and profitability.&rdquo;&ldquo;Several subjects have been in high demand lately. Some of them, in no particular order, are Global Supply Chain & Logistics, Research for Customer Insights, Customer Value Management, Entrepreneurship for Disruptive Launch, Data Analytics for Decision-making, Digital Marketing & Analytics, Demand Management, E-Business Strategies, Enterprise Innovation and Digital Transformation, FinTech and Technology Innovations, Teamwork and Leadership, Effective Business Communication & Negotiation Skills, etc,&quot; he added.&nbsp;Asked about the upcoming specialty trends he hoped to see in the coming years, he said: &quot;To navigate through the current age of turbulence, tomorrow&#39;s leaders need to be ambidextrous, playing both defence and offence. One needs to prudently manage the downside to mitigate risks while aggressively pursuing the upside to chase opportunities. They need to think about the next decade, not just the next week, month or year. To be part of a &#39;living&#39; organisation, one needs to consider their journey as a marathon, not a sprint. &#39;Risk management&#39; is becoming increasingly important to help organisations stay resilient while coping with ambiguity. &#39;Soft skills&#39; necessary to be truly professional are more important than ever before.

The launch marks an important step in making global-standard testing more accessible across the country.Biofortification--enriching food crops with essential minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium--is gaining global attention as a sustainable solution to malnutrition. But how do we know if a crop is truly biofortified? That's where technology steps in.Using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometry, the lab can quickly check if grains or flours contain the promised minerals. Unlike traditional lab testing, which can be time-consuming and expensive, XRF offers a smarter solution. It delivers rapid results, requires no chemical processing, and is cost-effective--making it ideal for widespread use across India's diverse agricultural landscape.What makes XRF testing a game-changer?* Rapid Results - Get results in a fraction of the time compared to traditional testing methods.* Cost-Effective - Ideal for researchers, seed and food processors who need affordable yet accurate analysis.* Early Screening - Perfect for identifying high-nutrient varieties during crop breeding.* Non-Invasive - No damage to the sample, allowing for continued use or further testing.The user-friendly portal can be accessed here: https://harvestplus.solutions/nutrient-testing/This initiative will help scientists, agribusinesses, and food companies ensure that the food they grow and sell is not just filling--but nourishing.Why this matters for IndiaIndia faces widespread micronutrient deficiencies, especially in iron and zinc. These deficiencies impact children's growth, women's health, and overall productivity. Biofortified crops offer a homegrown, food-based solution--but their success depends on verification. With this lab, India now has the power to verify nutrient-rich crops at scale.This also opens new opportunities for Indian food brands and agri-exporters. Verified nutrient-rich foods can meet growing consumer demand for healthier options--both in domestic and international markets.\"We're proud to make this testing technology more accessible through the portal,\" said Ravinder Grover, COO, HarvestPlus Solutions. \"It enables everyone in the value chain--from breeders to buyers--to base decisions on credible data.\"Building a truly nourishing futureThe lab supports HarvestPlus Solutions' broader mission: to make biofortification accessible, trusted, and scalable.

For example, our direct flights stopped during Covid, they were not resumed,&quot; he said.&quot;The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra stopped during Covid. It did not again resume. I think there is work to be done. We are at it,&quot; he said.&quot;We are sort of trying to see whether lot of this post-Covid and parallel to the border tension, the combination of these issues -- how much we can progress on this,&quot; Jaishankar added.The external affairs minister said both sides are looking into these issues.&quot;We are looking at it because at the end of the day we have always maintained that the situation, which we saw between 2020 and 2024, was not in the interest of either country,&quot; he said.&quot;It was not in the interest of our relationship. And I think there is a recognition of that now,&quot; he added.Last month, India and China explored ways to rebuild ties and agreed to initiate efforts to promote people-to-people exchanges, including arrangements for resumption of direct flights and resume Kailash Manasarovar Yatra this year.In December NSA Ajit Doval travelled to Beijing and held talks with Foreign Minister Wang under the framework of Special Representatives (SR) dialogue on the boundary question.In January, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Beijing and held talks with his Chinese counterpart Sun Weidong.", "keywords": ["Narendra Modi ministry", "S.

She and her party, the Indian National Congress, had to face a humiliating electoral defeat. Democracy emerged stronger from this reverse. Since then India has undergone significant political, economic and social changes.

Speaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2025 on Wednesday, Sachs emphasised that India should not allow itself to be used as a tool in Washington&rsquo;s strategy to counter Beijing.&nbsp;Sachs warns India against being a pawn in US-China rivalrySachs said the United States wants India to criticise China, describing such moves as part of a broader American agenda. He urged India to chart its own course in foreign policy.&nbsp;&ldquo;The US wants to use India to beat up China,&rdquo; Sachs said, adding, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the American game&hellip; India is too big for a US game.&rdquo; He noted that Washington has long sought to pit nations against each other to preserve its global influence, with India now being positioned as a counterweight to China.&nbsp;&ldquo;The US wants to use India, clearly. It wants to use India to beat up China,&rdquo; Sachs reiterated.&nbsp;Sachs acknowledged that India and China have their own disputes but suggested that resolving them bilaterally would be in both countries&rsquo; best interest. &ldquo;I know India and China have their own issues, but settle them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Between the two of you, you&rsquo;re 40 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population, and you could actually help to run a very decent world together.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be pulled into it,&rdquo; he cautioned.&nbsp;Strategic alliances like Quad serve US interests, not India&rsquo;sSachs also criticised India&rsquo;s involvement in strategic groupings such as the Quad, suggesting that these alliances primarily serve US interests.&nbsp; ALSO READ |&nbsp;China calls on India to stand together against US tariffs amid trade war&nbsp;&ldquo;So the US loves for India to be in the Quad. It wants India to bash China. I heard some Indian politicians recently saying, no, it&rsquo;s not Donald Trump&rsquo;s trade policy, it&rsquo;s all because of China. No, not exactly. It&rsquo;s actually because of Donald Trump. So just be careful not to play the game&hellip; India is too big for a US game,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&lsquo;US friendship often ends in turmoil&rsquo;Sachs warned that the United States is driven by a deep-rooted fear of losing global dominance. He described US foreign policy as one centred on control, often at the expense of its allies. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a friend of the United States, beware. Very dangerous,&rdquo; Sachs remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived a whole lifetime in America declaring its friendship to countries that end up getting destroyed in part because of that wonderful friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sachs also noted that both China and India have risen as major economies despite their colonial histories. &ldquo;India was the largest or second-largest economy in the world for centuries until the British arrived and did their job for quite a while,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Rising India may face US resentment: SachsSachs suggested that as India climbs the global economic ladder, it may encounter the same resentment from the US that China currently faces. &ldquo;Americans hate China. They hate China&mdash;how dare you have a bigger economy than the United States? This violates every rule according to American thinking, and they will come to resent India, I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you, as you overtake the United States too,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;India on track to become world&rsquo;s largest economyDespite geopolitical tensions, Sachs expressed optimism about India&rsquo;s future. &ldquo;India is doing wonderfully,&rdquo; he said, crediting the country&rsquo;s leadership and policies for its rapid growth.

He described Trump&rsquo;s executive orders as unprecedented and destabilising. Referring to recent tariffs on China and other countries, Sachs said, &ldquo;For the first time in American history, we are in a one-man show right now&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t a vote of Congress, it wasn&rsquo;t even a discussion in Congress.

China remains India&rsquo;s top source of imports, with the value of inbound goods rising 9.8 per cent year-on-year to $65.89 billion between April and October 2024. In contrast, India&rsquo;s exports to China declined by 9.37 per cent to $8 billion during the same period, according to Commerce Ministry data.&nbsp;Earlier today, China urged India to join forces in opposing US-imposed tariffs. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in India condemned Washington&rsquo;s trade measures as an &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; that harms developing economies.&nbsp;The remarks followed US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s decision to impose an additional 50 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, bringing the cumulative tariff rate to 104 per cent this year. This move came after China imposed a 34 per cent duty on US goods. India currently faces a 26 per cent tariff from the US, with further announcements expected soon.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Jeffrey Sachs", "Rising Bharat Summit", "India-US", "India-China", "US-China", "Jeffrey Sachs", "US China trade war", "India China US", "Quad alliance", "Rising Bharat Summit", "US foreign policy", "India global economy", "Sachs India warning", "geopolitical strategy", "Indian in US china trade war", "Role of India in US China trade war"], "date": "2025-04-09T23:07:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900439", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:59:09"},

The bounce back in metal stock comes after a correction earlier this week on Trump&#39;s metal tariff hike plan. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index was up 0.70 per cent at 11:35 AM.&nbsp;Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, Hindustan Copper, Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL), JSW Steel, NMDC, Vedanta, and National Aluminium Company from the Nifty Metal index were up in the range of 2 per cent to 5 per cent.&nbsp;In the past one month, the Nifty Metal index has rallied 6 per cent as compared to a 0.5 per cent rise in the Nifty 50 index. However, in the past six months, the metal index has underperformed the market by falling 6 per cent as against a 4 per cent decline in the benchmark index.&nbsp;The domestic steel sector is characterised by demand cyclicality, volatility in raw material and metal prices, high regulatory risk, and the risk of imports. In addition, metal prices heavily depend on international prices, as the domestic market is open for imports. Steel producers are generally impacted by a weak rupee/dollar due to the imports of coking coal. However, the risk is somewhat mitigated by hedging and import parity of metal prices.&nbsp;China has been a key exporter in the international market in the recent past and accounts for about 50 per cent of the global steel production. Therefore, any change in its economic policies that could impact the government&#39;s infrastructure spending or tightening of environmental norms could materially impact steel prices, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).&nbsp;On Tuesday, February 11, 2025, the domestic rating agency upgraded Tata Steel&#39;s long-term debt rating to &#39;IND AAA&#39; from &#39;IND AA+&#39; with a &#39;Stable&#39; Outlook.&nbsp;Tata Steel share price gained 4 per cent today, to hit a high of Rs 137.44 on the NSE in the intraday trade. In two days, the stock has gained nearly 6 per cent. Moreover, it has recovered 12 per cent from its 52-week low of Rs 122.62 touched on January 13, 2025.&nbsp;SAIL share price, meanwhile, rallied 5 per cent today to a high of Rs 110.79, surging 11 per cent in the past two trading days. The stock of the state-owned company had hit a 52-week low of Rs 99.15 on Wednesday, February 12, 2025. It has corrected 43 per cent from its 52-week high level of Rs 175.35 touched on May 22, 2024.&nbsp;In Q3FY25, SAIL&#39;s sales volumes witnessed a steady growth in the quarter. However, the company witnessed a sharp decline in steel realisation, down by Rs 5,000/tonne quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) to Rs 55,200/tonne in Q3FY25 - the steepest fall among major steel players.&nbsp;Additionally, Ebitda/tonne declined by Rs 2,500/tonne Q-o-Q despite coking coal price staying low in Q3FY25, according to ICICI Securities.&nbsp;The brokerage firm said they look forward to management&#39;s insights on the overall steel demand and profitability outlook. Furthermore, any potential imposition of duties on steel imports will have a positive impact on the company, it added.&nbsp;According to analysts at Elara Capital, the reductions in steel imports in the past two months have been attributed to the expiration of BIS certification for international mills. However, with the expected renewal of BIS certification for a Vietnam-based mill in January 2025, steel imports to India may see an uptick by mid-CY25, particularly following the completion of the ongoing anti-dumping investigation (assuming that no safeguard duty is imposed).&nbsp;Also, post the Chinese New Year, ramp-up in China&#39;s steel production with the US tariffs on indirect steel exports may exert downward pressure on global steel prices. Given these dynamics, the brokerage firm believes long products will outperform flat products in the ferrous sector.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Nifty Metal index", "Markets", "metal index", "metal stocks", "metal stocks list", "metal stocks nse", "Q3", "Steel Authority of India", "SAIL share price", "Tata Steel share price", "Hindustan Copper share price", "Jindal Steel and Power share price", "JSPL share price", "JSW Steel share price", "NMDC share price", "Vedanta share price", "National Aluminium Company share price", "NALCO share price", "India Ratings and Research", "Ind-Ra", "Elara Capital", "tata steel share price today", "SAIL share price today", "Nifty meta index share price today", "Nifty meta share price news"], "date": "2025-02-13T13:01:26+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021300680", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:59:23"},

As steelmakers, we laughed. Let me admit that we laughed that 300 MT in India, at that time we were barely at 80 million (MT). We said by 2030 it is a joke. Three months back, we sat down and revised our target and said, no, by 2030, not 300 MT but 330 MT,&quot; the chairman said.&nbsp;The demand elasticity is amazing. Last year, the Indian steel sector grew at 14 per cent against GDP growth of 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent.

Some steel was being exported to the US from Europe. Once the reciprocal tariffs take effect, such exports would become unviable.&quot;That will mean Asian countries -- China, South Korea, Japan -- that are exporting to Europe, that steel becomes free and will be floating around in the world. This floating trade might come to India,&quot; he said.When asked if the tariff will impact India&#39;s exports of steel to the US, the chairman said it will not affect much as the commodity&#39;s outbound shipment is not in large quantity.&quot;That is not a big challenge. The critical steel or critical components, those capabilities do not get developed overnight. So the prices will go up, but the US will continue to import those items which they do not produce. Setting up a manufacturing unit for those things will take time,&quot; Prakash said.About the demand to curb cheap imports in the country, Prakash said the safeguard duty is urgent for the domestic steel industry.The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the investigation arm of the commerce ministry, last month recommended imposition of a 12 per cent provisional safeguard duty for 200 days on certain steel products with an aim to protect domestic players from surge in imports.The final decision to impose the duty will be taken by the finance ministry.On the DGTR investigations related to metallurgical coke, he said quantitative restrictions (QR) are already in place &quot;but curbs won&#39;t hurt steel producers&quot;.", "keywords": ["US tariffs", "steel imports", "India", "global trade", "SAIL chairman", "steel industry", "Amarendu Prakash", "reciprocal tariffs", "safeguard duty"], "date": "2025-04-02T16:53:17+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040200813", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:59:24"},

The Budget could only be presented in July, resulting in a loss of six months. That&rsquo;s the main reason.&rdquo;&nbsp;Procurement in FY24 was Rs 53,0151.48 crore, of which that from MSEs owned by entrepreneurs belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) amounted to Rs 1,689.59 crore, an increase from Rs 1,616.01 crore in FY23.&nbsp;Additionally, annual procurement in FY24 from MSEs owned by women was Rs 3,252.66 crore, up from Rs 2,403.46 crore in FY23.&nbsp;The government notified the Public Procurement Policy for MSEs in 2012, and it is administered by the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, effective from April 1, 2012.

These amendments came into effect on April 1, 2019.&nbsp;&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s push for CPSE procurement from MSEs has yielded great results, but continuing procurement needs a mindset shift among CPSE management from a carrot-and-stick approach to a true realization of MSEs&rsquo; role in nation-building,&rdquo; said Vinod Kumar, president of the India SME Forum.&nbsp;However, if MSEs belonging to SC/ST entrepreneurs fail to participate in the tender process or meet tender requirements and L1 prices (lowest-quoted selling price), the 4 per cent sub-target can be met from other MSEs.&nbsp;From 2015-16, the procurement goal of a minimum of 20 per cent became mandatory.

No talks have been held yet,&quot; the two-time chief minister said.On Tuesday, when asked about alliances especially in states such as Haryana, Congress general secretary, in-charge organisation, K C Venugopal had said, &quot;We have already discussed the poll preparations in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir. Wherever alliances are needed, the local unit is deciding, they will go for that.&quot;Hooda&#39;s remarks also came weeks after Congress general secretary, in-charge communications, Jairam Ramesh said there does not appear to be much scope for an alliance between the Congress and the AAP for the assembly polls in Haryana and Delhi but the INDIA bloc will fight elections together in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.In an interview with PTI, Ramesh had said there is no one formula the INDIA bloc will follow for state elections. The grouping will fight together in states where Congress leaders and other alliance partners agree to such an understanding, he had said.The Congress and the AAP had fought the Lok Sabha polls together in Delhi while they contested separately in Punjab. The Congress had given one seat to the AAP in Harayana in the general elections.Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra are slated to go for assembly polls later this year. Elections are due early next year in Delhi.Hooda, 76, also said the Agnipath military recruitment scheme as well as the legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for crops are big issues in Haryana.&quot;If a Congress government comes, we are opposing this (Agnipath) scheme because what will a person do after returning from service, following four years. They (central government) say Agniveers will get reservation but there is already reservation for ex-servicemen. What will they do after four years?&quot; the senior Congress leader asked.Every year, around 5,000 people used to be selected in the armed forces but this year only 250 were selected, he said.Haryana&#39;s population share in the country is 2 per cent but every 10th soldier in the army is from the state, Hooda said.&quot;This government should withdraw the Agniveer scheme,&quot; Hooda said.The issue of legal guarantee for MSP is a legitimate demand of farmers, he said.&quot;In the Raipur Congress plenary session, we had declared that the legal guarantee for MSP would be given,&quot; Hooda said.The BJP had promised that farmers&#39; income will be doubled by 2022. This did not happen but the input costs have gone up, he said. Hooda cited the spike in the cost of diesel, fertilisers and pesticides.&quot;In our time there was neither a tax on fertilizers nor on pesticides. There was 9 per cent tax in our time on diesel, they (BJP government) have increased it to 18 per cent. So, the input cost has gone up but farmers&#39; income has gone down,&quot; the Congress leader said.So, if sustainable income has to be ensured for farmers, legal guarantee for MSP should be given, Hooda said.Talking about the guarantees, given by the Haryana Congress, Hooda said if the party comes to power, old-age pension will be increased to Rs 6,000, the old pension scheme will be brought back, gas cylinder will be available at Rs 500, 300 units of electricity will be free, and 2 lakh vacant posts will be filled up.Hooda said if a Congress government comes to power it will also improve the law and order situation and get more investments to the state to give a boost to job creation.&quot;There is no investment coming in because money is being extorted from people.

This decision follows the government&rsquo;s failure to release reimbursements amounting to Rs 400 crore.&nbsp;Ayushman Bharat, which currently includes approximately 1,300 hospitals in Haryana &mdash; 600 of which are private &mdash; has faced significant financial issues. A doctor from one of the empanelled hospitals in Gurugram expressed concern over the mounting difficulty of running hospitals without timely payments. &ldquo;The reimbursement process is slow, and new bills keep adding up. Immediate release of payments is essential for us to continue functioning,&rdquo; the doctor explained.&nbsp;Mahavir Jain, president of IMA Haryana, confirmed that private hospitals have been waiting for reimbursement for several months. He underlined the urgency of the situation, saying, &ldquo;Hospitals cannot operate without the necessary funds. Around Rs 400 crore is still pending, and these bills have already been discounted by the hospitals. How can they continue if they do not receive basic payments?&rdquo;&nbsp;IMA officials reported that hospitals have received only 10-15 per cent of the reimbursements they were owed. Typically, hospitals submit reimbursement requests via an online portal after treating Ayushman Bharat patients, with the state government then approving and reimbursing the costs. However, delays in processing these payments have left many hospitals struggling.&nbsp;Ayushman Bharat: CM instructs prompt release of funds&nbsp;Despite raising the issue with Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini, who instructed the prompt release of funds, hospitals have only seen a partial distribution of the outstanding amounts. Dhirendar K Soni, the secretary of IMA Haryana, lamented, &ldquo;Even after 15 days, no significant amount has been received. The funds released have been subject to substantial, unjustified deductions.&rdquo;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Ankita Adhikari, joint CEO of Ayushman Bharat in Haryana, responded to the announcement by stating that her office had not been informed of the cessation of services. &ldquo;We have already initiated the fund release process, and we are confident that the issue will be resolved within a week. We hope such drastic measures will not be necessary,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Gurugram hospitals suspend services over reimbursements&nbsp;Several hospitals in Gurugram, including Park Hospital, Centre for Sight, Pushpanjali Hospital, and Kamla Hospital, are among those affected by the decision.

Approximately 10.2 million individuals in Haryana are enrolled in the scheme, which covers a wide range of healthcare services, from routine tests to surgeries.

This figure underscores Haryana&rsquo;s relative economic strength, particularly within its agrarian base.&nbsp;On similar lines, a recent paper by members of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Economic Advisory Council, Sanjeev Sanyal and Akanksha Arora, indicates Haryana&rsquo;s per capita income at 176.8 per cent of the national figure &ndash; the fourth-highest in the nation.&nbsp;However, according to data from the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department of Haryana, a total of 19,890,964 people &ndash; around 71 per cent of the state&rsquo;s 2.8 crore population &ndash; figure below the Poverty Line (BPL) bracket. Household income is capped at Rs1,80,000 for BPL by Haryana government.&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest number of BPL population of Haryana lives in:&nbsp;Faridabad &gt; 1,429,691&nbsp;Hisar &gt; 1,355,505&nbsp;Mewat &gt; 1,349,804&nbsp;Karnal &gt; 1,185,310&nbsp;Sirsa &gt; 1,067,556&nbsp;Sonipat &gt; 1,056,943&nbsp;Panipat &gt; 1,053,612&nbsp;Jind &gt; 1,045,581&nbsp;Yamunanagar &gt; 1,015,607&nbsp;and Palwal &gt; 1,014,731.&nbsp;Increase in BPL population&nbsp;According to data available with the Aadhar-enabled Public Distribution System of the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, a total of 267,693 people have become new entrants under BPL in 13 days of November 2024 alone. This marks an increase of 812,198 compared to September&rsquo;s figure of 19,078,766. In 2024 alone (till Nov 13), around 2.02 million people are newly added to the BPL category. In December 2022, the department listed around 12.4 million people, or 44 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, were classified as poor. Over the past two years, this number has grown, with an additional 7.5 million people now living in poverty.&nbsp;Easy entry into BPL category&nbsp;Analysts point out that the latest data may not depict the exact picture of Haryana&rsquo;s poverty scenario. The reason lies in the registration process. BPL cards in Haryana are issued based on the Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP). PPP is a family ID card, containing a unique eight-digit number. The card contains details of the family such as the head of the family, name of family members, their age, income etc. A PPP holder is required to provide &lsquo;self-certification&rsquo; of the household income. For BPL cards, the income is pegged at Rs 1,80,000 per year per family. Analysts point out that the declared income under PPP is never certified or cross-checked at the government level.&nbsp;Benefits under BPL&nbsp;Like any other state, Haryana offers several welfare schemes for people below the poverty line. The state offers 5 kg of foodgrains per person (free of cost), 2 litres of subsidised mustard oil, and 1 kg sugar at Rs 13.5 to BPL cardholders. According to a report by The Tribune, the state &lsquo;distributes an estimated 10 lakh quintals of grain free of cost every month&rsquo;. Recently, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini has also announced 100 square yard plots for BPL families living in rural areas. Experts highlight the need to rectify the discrepancies in the BPL system through proper official checks.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Haryana", "per capita income", "Poverty Line", "Economic Advisory Council", "Sanjeev Sanyal", "Nayab Singh Saini"], "date": "2024-11-13T11:17:36+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124111300584", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 11:59:57"},

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assumed power, he is working to let the country forward... They (Congress) have it in their DNA to oppose everything. They have now understood that they are not coming in 2029 as well...,&quot; he told reportersIn a post on X, Kharge highlighted previous actions, such as the removal of the Chief Justice of India from the ECI selection panel, and claimed that the government is now stonewalling crucial electoral information despite a High Court order.&quot;Modi Government&#39;s audacious amendment in the Conduct of Election Rules is another assault in its systematic conspiracy to destroy the institutional integrity of the Election Commission of India. Earlier, they had removed the Chief Justice of India from the Selection panel which appoints Election Commissioners, and now they have resorted to stonewall electoral information, even after a High Court order,&quot; he said.&quot;Every time the Congress party wrote to the ECI, regarding specific poll irregularities such as voter deletions and lack of transparency in EVMs, the ECI has responded in a condescending tone and chosen not to even acknowledge certain serious complaints. This again proves that the ECI, even though is a quasi-judicial body is not behaving independently. Modi Govt&#39;s calibrated erosion of ECI&#39;s integrity is a frontal attack on the Constitution and Democracy and we will take every step to safeguard them,&quot; Kharge added.This came in the wake of a recent Punjab and Haryana High Court directive in the Mahmoud Pracha vs ECI case, where the court ordered the sharing of all documents related to the Haryana Assembly elections, including CCTV footage under Rule 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.Based on a recommendation from the ECI, the amendment by the Centre restricts public scrutiny of certain electronic documents, including CCTV footage. The Union Law Ministry recently amended Rule 93(2) to specify which documents are open to public inspection.However, a senior ECI official clarified to ANI that the candidate already has access to all the documents and papers, and no amendments have been made to the rules in this regard.The ECI official noted that while the rule refers to &quot;election papers,&quot; it does not explicitly address electronic records. The ambiguity in the rule and concerns over potential misuse of CCTV footage inside polling stations, especially with advancements in artificial intelligence, prompted an amendment to safeguard voter secrecy and prevent its misuse.The official emphasized that sharing CCTV footage inside the polling stations from sensitive areas such as Jammu and Kashmir or Naxal-affected regions could compromise voter safety. &quot;Lives of voters may be at risk, and the secrecy of the vote must be protected,&quot; the official stated.

From Pawan Kalyan&rsquo;s meteoric rise in Andhra Pradesh to Thalapathy Vijay&rsquo;s bold foray into Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s Dravidian battleground, these politicians redefined conventional politics.&nbsp;Here&#39;s a closer look at five breakthrough politicians who made headlines in 2024:&nbsp;Pawan Kalyan&nbsp;Beginning his political journey in 2014 with the launch of Jan Sena Party (JSP), actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan has come a long way. In the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, his party won all 21 Assembly seats it contested and also secured two Lok Sabha seats in the simultaneous general elections.&nbsp;Unlike his elder brother Chiranjeevi, who merged his Praja Rajyam Party with Congress after facing electoral defeats, Kalyan and his JSP remained undeterred by the initial setbacks.&nbsp;In 2019, Kalyan went to the polls in alliance with left parties. The JSP could win only one seat, with Kalyan himself losing from both the seats he contested. Realising the public sentiments, he crafted a new strategy for his party.&nbsp;In 2024, his party contested polls in alliance with the BJP and Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party (TDP). The alliance emerged victorious, which led to Kalyan getting the Deputy Chief Minister&#39;s post in the state.&nbsp;Thalapathy Vijay&nbsp;Tamil Nadu, a state where cinema and power have been synonymous, saw a new political entrant - &lsquo;Thalapathy&rsquo; Vijay. Among the highest paid actors in the country, Vijay launched his party Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) in February this year, and made his debut speech in front of a 300,000 crowd in October.&nbsp;Outlining his political vision and ideological position, the 50-year-old tapped the &#39;Dravidam&#39; card to challenge the ruling DMK while he voiced concerns over &quot;politics of hate,&quot; in a bid to corner the budding BJP in the state.&nbsp;Vijay is now eyeing on the 2026 Assembly polls, where he would aim to fill the political void created by a weakened AIADMK.&nbsp;Nayab Singh Saini&nbsp;Nobody expected that the BJP would be able to return to power in Haryana, especially after the party brought in a new chief minister in the middle of the term. However, Nayab Singh Saini made the impossible possible, leading the party out of tough waters of anti-incumbency and Jat unrest.&nbsp;Due to his close ties with former CM Manohar Lal Khattar and his OBC identity, Saini solidified his position in the state&#39;s political landscape. In 2023, he was made the BJP&rsquo;s state unit chief, where he replaced Om Prakash Dhankar, party&#39;s Jat face in Haryana.&nbsp;In the 2024 Haryana Assembly polls, the BJP&#39;s thrust on OBC vote to counter the Congress&#39; Jat vote-base worked with Saini leading the way.&nbsp;Nara Lokesh&nbsp;Once considered politically raw, Nara Lokesh played a prominent role in the TDP&#39;s return to power in Andhra Pradesh. Son of N Chandrababu Naidu, Lokesh was often criticised for not winning an election ever. However, he changed the perception in 2024 by winning from Mangalagiri constituency, which had never been won by the TDP in 39 years.&nbsp;The 41-year old MBA from Stanford is said to have used technology extensively to fuel his party&#39;s agenda in state politics. It helped him in connecting with the masses, particularly the youth.&nbsp;Lokesh started a 400-day padyatra (foot march) which he started in January 2023 to prepare the ground for the TDP&rsquo;s comeback in the state. The padyatra helped him in coming out of his father&#39;s shadow, and crafting his own image. His role became more prominent after his father&#39;s arrest in a skill development corporation scam. He halted the yatra, took charge of the party and launched an offensive against Jagan Mohan Reddy&#39;s YSRCP.&nbsp;Kalpana Soren&nbsp;Kalpana Soren, the wife of Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, kept a low profile until her husband&#39;s arrest in a money laundering case forced her to come out of the shadows. She not only took the reins of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) party but also became the central figure in election campaigning.&nbsp;Contesting elections, she defeated her nearest BJP rival by a margin of 17,142 votes from Gandey.&nbsp;The husband-wife duo is said to have addressed nearly 200 political rallies in the Assembly election.

We thought people would vote for us based on our current schemes but that did not happen. We will analyse this.

So, the state government was keeping track of Sachin Pilot and the people he was meeting. Sachin Pilot was being monitored on where he was going, and who was he talking on to the phone so that corrective measures could be taken.&quot;He further said that Congress was able to save its government due to the monitoring of Pilot.&quot;It was because of the monitoring that we could bring some people back. He was also being chased and all his movements were tracked. I believe Sachin Pilot was aware of this and that he is being monitored,&quot; Lokesh Sharma said.This is bound to increase tensions between the two leaders even as the Congress is likely to name a new state President and a new leader of opposition.In the Assembly elections in four states--Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh--the counting of which concluded on December 3, the BJP emerged victorious in majorities of the seats in the three North Indian states.While in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the BJP defeated the incumbent Congress governments, in Madhya Pradesh, it defeated the anti-incumbency in retaining power. However, in the South Indian state of Telangana, the Congress saw consolation and emerged victorious, dethroning BRS&#39;s decade-old rule.In Rajasthan, the BJP won 115 seats out of 199, clearly ousting the incumbent Ashok Gehlot government.

Full list, details", "content": "The upcoming Assembly elections in Haryana is brimming with high-stake political drama between the ruling BJP and Congress, making it one of the most anticipated contests since the Lok Sabha elections.The election victory will be crucial for the BJP to dismiss the claims made by the Opposition about its waning influence in the aftermath of the Lok Sabha poll results. The party is facing a major challenge of anti-incumbency after being in power for 10 years in the state. For Congress, it is a moment to shine after a strong comeback in the general elections. Both parties won five seats each in the Haryana Lok Sabha, further adding to the anticipation of the Assembly poll outcome on October 8.ALSO READ:&nbsp;Haryana elections: Complete list of BJP candidates on all 90 constituenciesHowever, beyond the two parties, a lot is going on in the political landscape of Haryana. Besides external battles, the BJP is also facing an internal crisis after several of its key leaders resigned from the party for being denied tickets in the polls. Meanwhile, the Congress appears very confident of winning the polls, however, it remains to be seen if the Aam Aadmi Party&rsquo;s plan to run solo on all 90 seats will dampen the Congress prospects by splitting the vote share. For context, the AAP contested 46 seats in the last Assembly polls but secured less than 1 per cent votes. In the Lok Sabha polls this time, it secured about 3.5 per cent votes, the data on the Election Commission website shows.The polling will take place on all seats in a single phase on October 5 but on the result day, 11 seats are expected to keep everyone on the edge of their seats.Business Standard explains why these 11 Haryana seats matterGarhi Sampla-Kiloi: Congress&rsquo;s power hub in Haryana1) Garhi Sampla-Kiloi is the bastion of former Congress Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, one of the most important Jat leaders in the state. The Jat community makes up 25 per cent of Haryana population and is central to the Deswali-belt that comprises Rohtak, Jhajjar and Sonipat districts. Subsequently, the Congress has given 26 tickets to Jat candidates. In comparison, the BJP which shares a weak base among the Jats, has given 16 tickets to the community. Hooda, the two-time former CM of Haryana has a political career spanning five decades. He has never once lost an election. In hopes to counter him, the BJP has fielded Manju Hooda: Wife of gangster Rajesh Hooda. Manju is the daughter of a former senior Haryana policeman.Tosham constituency: Dynasty politics to play out among two cousins2) From Tosham, the Congress has nominated cricket administrator-turned-politician Anirudh Chaudhary. On the other hand, the BJP has countered with Shruti Choudhry, making this seat a key contest as both candidates are cousins and grandchildren of the late former Haryana CM Bansi Lal.Ambala Cantt: Stronghold of senior BJP leader Anil Vij&nbsp;3) Ambala Cantt is one of the key constituencies in Haryana, from where 71-year-old BJP leader Anil Vij has been six-time MLA. One of the most powerful ministers under former CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Vij oversaw the home ministry department in Haryana when Nuh violence took place in 2023. However, he has stayed away from the incumbent Nayab Singh Saini cabinet. Notably, when Vij filed his nominations on Thursday, he was not accompanied by any senior BJP leader.&nbsp;In this seat, the Congress has chosen Parvinder Singh Pari. However, before facing off against the BJP, the party has to first contend with an internal strife, as Chitra Sarwara &ndash; the daughter of Nirmal Singh, another Congress candidate from Ambala &mdash; has decided to run as an independent candidate. Sarwara had contested the seat as an independent candidate last time and lost to Vij by 20,000 votes.Ladwa: Why did CM Nayab Saini leave Karnal for this seat?4) Haryana CM Saini has been leading the state since March (after Khattar&#39;s resignation to run in the Lok Sabha elections). He was elected to the Assembly in a by-poll contest from Karnal, the stronghold of Khattar. It is learned that Saini was keen to defend his Karnal seat in the elections but he has been &ldquo;reluctantly&rdquo; fielded from Ladwa, which is being seen as the &ldquo;safest&rdquo; seat for the BJP. In the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 47.14 per cent of the vote in the Ladwa Assembly segment of the Kurukshetra constituency. While this is lower than the 58.5 per cent it achieved in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, it is a significant improvement over the 32.7 per cent it received in the 2019 Assembly elections.In this seat, the Congress has named Mewa Singh, the incumbent MLA who won the 2019 polls by a narrow margin of 12,637 votes.Badli constituency: BJP trusts Jat leader Om Prakash Dhankar5) On Badli seat, the BJP has fielded Om Prakash Dhankar, a former Haryana BJP president, who is a Jat leader and also served as a former state minister. Dhankar, who won this seat in 2014, lost in 2019 to Congress rival Kuldeep Vats, who will also contest the coming polls to retain his seat.Notably, Dhankar was replaced as the state unit president last year by Saini, who was then a Lok Sabha MP from Kurukshetra.&nbsp;Hodal seat: Congress Haryana chief to contest this reserved constituency6) The Hodal constituency is reserved for the scheduled castes, where the BJP decided to drop its incumbent MLA Jagdish Nayar and place a bet on Harinder Singh Ramrattan. Last time, Nayar had won this year by a margin of only about 3,300 votes. The outcome of this seat is crucial for the Congress, which gave the ticket to its state unit Chief Udai Bhan, who has represented this seat four times.Hisar: India&rsquo;s richest woman Savitri Jindal to contest independently7) While Hisar is an important constituency in itself, this time it has gained more prominence as India&rsquo;s richest woman Savitri Jindal has decided to contest from here as an independent candidate. This followed after the BJP did not give the ticket to Jindal but renominated its sitting MLA and state Health Minister Kamal Gupta. Notably, Jindal, boasting a staggering net worth of $33 billion, quit the Congress in March and switched over to the BJP. Her shift to the BJP came shortly after her son, industrialist Naveen Jindal also joined the party. Naveen is a BJP MP from Kurukshetra.The Congress has named Ram Niwas Rara from this seat.Kaithal: Randeep Surjewala&rsquo;s son Aditya makes poll debut bid8) Congress leader Randeep Surjewala&rsquo;s son Aditya will contest the upcoming Assembly polls from Kaithal, the seat represented by his father two times. Randeep had lost the seat in 2019 to BJP&rsquo;s Leela Ram Gurjar, who will try to defend his seat.Julana constituency: Will Vinesh Phogat lock her Haryana Assembly entry?9) One of the most high-profile constituencies this time, Julana seat ticket marks the beginning of Olympian wrestler Vinesh Phogat&rsquo;s political career. She will fight the battle against BJP&rsquo;s Capt Yogesh Bairagi and AAP&rsquo;s Kavita Devi, also a wrestler. Phogat, who recently joined the Congress, is expected to solidify the party&rsquo;s influence among farmers, youth and women.Uchana: JJP leader Dushyant Chautala looks to cement his influence10)&nbsp; Former Haryana deputy CM and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala will contest the polls from Uchana seat in Jind to defend it against BJP&rsquo;s Devender Attri and Congress&rsquo; Brijendra Singh. Singh, a former IAS and BJP turncoat, joined Congress in March this year. In the 2019 elections, Chautala defeated Prem Lata, mother of Singh and wife Birender Singh, who is a former Union Minister.Like his son, Birender Singh, was also a former Congressman, who had joined the BJP in 2014, and then made a U-turn to the Congress again.Chautala&rsquo;s re-election bid from Uchana holds significance for his party, which is experiencing a shrink in influence in Haryana. JJP had emerged as a &ldquo;kingmaker&rdquo; in the 2019 Assembly elections and helped the BJP to form a government.Ellenabad: Abhay Singh Chautala eyes re-election bid11) Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) general secretary Abhay Singh will contest the polls to retain his Ellenabad seat in Sirsa. Like JJP, INLD has also lost its influence in the Haryana political landscape. The party has been out of power in Haryana for 20 years and got a 1.74 per cent vote share in the Lok Sabha polls. Here, the Congress has named Bharat Singh Beniwal and the BJP has given a ticket to Amir Chand Mehta, who is associated with the Rashtriya Swayam Sangh.Chautala has represented the seat since 2010. Previously, it was held by his father OP Chautala.Karnal: What happens to Manohar Lal Khattar seat?12) Karnal is the hot seat from where Khattar, a non-Jat leader, shaped the BJP&rsquo;s leadership in Haryana during his nearly 10 years in power. This time, the saffron party has fielded Jagmohan Anand, a close aide of Khattar, while the Congress has named Sumita Virk. Anand was Khattar&rsquo;s former media coordinator and ex-Karnal district president..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}", "keywords": ["Haryana Assembly elections", "Haryana Assembly elections date", "Haryana Assembly elections key seats", "Haryana Assembly elections key constituencies", "Haryana elections latest news", "Haryana News", "Haryana Assembly polls", "Haryana Assembly polls 2024", "Haryana elections updates", "Haryana election news", "Haryana polls candidates", "Haryana Assembly election results", "Haryana polls live updates", "Haryana election schedule", "Haryana voting dates", "Haryana election predictions", "Haryana Assembly election candidates", "Haryana polls", ""], "date": "2024-09-13T17:31:38+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124091301004", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:00:45"},

This move came after a recommendation from the council of ministers, headed by Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini, who advised the early dissolution to avert a possible constitutional crisis.The recommendation for dissolution was put forward to avoid the necessity of convening the House before the end of the six-month period that follows the Assembly&#39;s most recent meeting, as mandated by the Constitution.

She stated that the symbol of &#39;Hand&#39; will act as a slap and will strike the BJP government on October 5.Reacting to this statement, Mahavir Singh Phogat said, &quot;Using such language is really bad, it should not be used&quot;.Mahavir Phogat also expressed concern over Vinesh&#39;s foray into politics, suggesting that it was not her intention to enter the political arena. He indicated that Vinesh was pushed into politics for political gain by figures like Deepender Hooda and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Hooda.In support of Babita Phogat&#39;s statement that Vinesh was drawn into politics through a Congress conspiracy, Mahavir Phogat agreed, asserting that the public expected Vinesh to focus on competing in the 2028 Olympics and bringing home a gold medal.&quot;The last time they did protests, it was not politically influenced, but Deepender Hooda and Bhupinder Hooda influenced her to join politics.

Phogat is contesting from the Julana seat in Jind district on a Congress ticket.After casting her vote at Balali in Charkhi Dadri district, Phogat said, &quot;People of Haryana have huge expectations from the Congress. Everyone should come and cast their votes.&quot;Replying to a query, she said unemployment, drugs and women&#39;s safety are some of the major issues facing the state.&quot;We want to work in all areas in the coming five years. Today is the day of change, today is the day to awaken new hope. I appeal to the people of Haryana to come out of their homes and recognise their power,&quot; Phogat said.The Congress nominee also said that the people of Haryana are fed up with the 10-year rule of the BJP and accused the party of committing atrocities against farmers and wrestlers.Her rival candidate from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), wrestler Kavita Dalal, also appealed to voters to exercise their franchise.She claimed that people would be voting on the issues of unemployment, health and education, adding that everybody would play their role in Julana&#39;s development.Meanwhile, wrestler and Congress leader Bajrang Punia claimed that there is a Congress wave across Haryana. He said the party will win between 60 and 70 seats.Speaking to reporters in Jhajjar, Punia alleged that the people of Haryana have understood that the BJP only played politics of casteism and hatred.He also claimed that Phogat would win from Julana with a big margin.Punia&#39;s wife Sangeeta Phogat said she voted for the first time on Saturday, exuding confidence that the Congress will form the government in Haryana.&quot;Everybody in the state wants a change,&quot; she added.Meanwhile, Vinesh Phogat&#39;s cousin and BJP leader Babita Phogat also urged people to come out of their homes and cast their votes.&quot;Celebrate this festival of democracy by casting your vote,&quot; the former wrestler said after casting her vote in Charkhi Dadri.She also sounded confident of the BJP forming the government with a full mandate on October 8, the counting day.Double Olympic medallist shooter Manu Bhaker, who also cast her vote for the first time in Jhajjar, said, &quot;It is the duty of the youth to select their representatives.&quot;Kurukshetra MP Naveen Jindal reached the polling station on a horse to cast his vote.&quot;Riding a horse is considered auspicious...

While Exit polls had also hinted at a strong showing for Congress, the BJP remained optimistic about securing a third consecutive term. With intense competition across 90 assembly seats and more than 1,000 candidates, these eight crucial contests could shape the direction of Haryana&rsquo;s political future.Key constituencies to watch out for in Haryana Assembly elections:Ellenabad: The Chautala fortress&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellenabad, located in Sirsa district, is an essential seat for senior INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala. He is up against BJP&rsquo;s Amir Chand Mehta and AAP&rsquo;s Manish Arora. In 2019, Chautala narrowly won this seat, making it one of the key races to watch.Sohna: Independent candidates tilt the balance&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohna, in southern Haryana, presents a contest between BJP&rsquo;s Tejpal Tanwar and Congress&rsquo;s Rohtas Singh Khatana. However, the inclusion of two prominent independent candidates, including a former BJP leader who rebelled after being denied a ticket, adds further complexity. This race could potentially alter the region&rsquo;s political dynamics.Uchana Kalan: Battle between political titans&nbsp;&nbsp;In Uchana Kalan, a constituency in Jind district with a large Jat population, the competition is fierce. Congress&rsquo;s Brijendra Singh, a former BJP MP, is challenging JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, who is seeking re-election. Dushyant, the grandson of former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, faces stiff competition. His success could cement his party&rsquo;s position in the area.Garhi: Bhupinder faces off Manju Hooda&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garhi constituency features a contest between Congress veteran Bhupinder Singh Hooda and BJP&rsquo;s Manju Hooda. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who has held the seat since 2009, is facing a significant challenge from his BJP counterpart in this election.Julana: Two wrestlers in the ring&nbsp;&nbsp;In Julana, two well-known women wrestlers take centre stage. Congress&rsquo;s Olympian Vinesh Phogat is competing against AAP&rsquo;s Kavita Dalal, the first Indian woman to fight in WWE. Phogat campaigns as &lsquo;Julana ki Bahu&rsquo; (daughter-in-law), while Dalal brands herself as &lsquo;Julana ki Beti&rsquo; (daughter). Additionally, BJP&rsquo;s Yogesh Bairagi, a pilot, and JJP&rsquo;s incumbent MLA Amarjeet Singh Dhanda add further interest. With 40 per cent of the electorate being Jat, the outcome could indicate how much influence celebrity appeal has over established local leadership.Ladwa: CM Nayab Saini&rsquo;s position in jeopardy&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladwa, in Kurukshetra district, is a high-stakes constituency with Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini contesting. Saini, an OBC leader, is in a tough fight against Congress&rsquo;s Mewa Singh and INLD&rsquo;s Sapna Barshami. Although Saini holds sway over the Saini community, which accounts for around 7.5 per cent of Ladwa&rsquo;s population, the BJP lost this seat in 2019, making it a crucial race for the party.Rania: It&rsquo;s all a political family drama&nbsp;&nbsp;Rania&rsquo;s election is marked by a family dispute within the Chautala family. Ranjit Singh Chautala, the estranged brother of Om Prakash Chautala, is running as an independent after distancing himself from the BJP following his 2024 general election defeat. His grandnephew, Arjun Chautala of the INLD, is his main rival.

The poll panel gave him time till 8 pm on Wednesday to file his reply.AAP sources said the party chief will file his response over the issue.In the same course of event the Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched an all-out attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejrwal on Wednesday, saying his &quot;disgusting&quot; comment that the BJP-ruled Haryana was mixing &quot;poison&quot; in the Yamuna is a sign of desperation as the &quot;AAP-da&quot; can sense it is going to be drowned in the same river in these polls.Addressing a rally at Kartar Nagar, Modi likened AAP leaders to notorious fraudster and serial killer Charles Sobhraj, and said the &quot;AAP-da people&quot; have committed a &quot;sin&quot; that will not be forgotten by history, and the people of Haryana and the country.On Monday, Kejriwal alleged the BJP-ruled Haryana is supplying &quot;poison-mixed&quot; water to Delhi with the intention of killing people and blame it on the AAP to take electoral benefit.Saying that he has been drinking the Yamuna water for 11 years, the prime minister asked people, &quot;Can anyone imagine that the BJP government in Haryana was trying to poison me?&quot;&nbsp;Kejriwal&#39;s claims are an insult not just to Haryana but to all Indians, he said. &quot;It is an insult to Indian culture, an insult to our character.&quot;&nbsp;The &#39;AAP-da&#39; will drown in the same river, Modi said.&quot;A former CM has made malicious allegations against the people of Haryana. AAP-da people have become desperate due to the fear of a defeat. Is Haryana different from Delhi? Don&#39;t they have children and relatives in Delhi? Will they mix poison for their own people?&quot; Modi said.Modi said that not only the people of Delhi, but he himself, diplomats and judges staying in the national capital drink the same water that comes from Haryana.&quot;Can anyone think that to kill Modi, the Haryana BJP has mixed poison in water? Was there a conspiracy to kill judges in Delhi? What are you talking? It is in the character of Indians to forgive mistakes but neither Delhi nor India forgives sins committed with ill-intention,&quot; he said.Kejriwal&#39;s comments have also invited the ire of BJP leaders in the state.Haryana Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Vipul Goel said on Wednesday the state government will get a case registered against Kejriwal for his &quot;irresponsible&quot; statement aimed at spreading panic among people.Back at the rally, Modi said Delhi has made it clear that now excuses, fake promises as well as &quot;loot and lies&quot; of the &quot;AAP-da&quot; government will not work. He made fervent appeal to voters to give him a chance to serve them, after 25 years of the Congress and AAP governments.Further hitting out at the AAP, he said that during the last two elections, the party asked for votes on the promise of cleaning the Yamuna and now it says that the issue does not yield votes.&quot;This is fraud and shamelessness. They want to make people struggle for water and want Purvanchalis to do chhathi maiya&#39;s puja surrounded by garbage,&quot; he said.Modi also said there is a possibility of a post-poll alliance between the AAP and the Congress in Delhi which will be a &quot;double AAP-DA&quot; for the people of the city&nbsp;&quot;The AAP-da (disaster, a reference to AAP) has sensed its defeat as there is a lot of anger among the public against each of their MLAs. That&#39;s why the AAP and Congress have formed a back door alliance with each other.&quot;The AAP-da is trying to ensure that if not their candidates, then Congress&#39; candidates win so they can jointly capture power later,&quot; he said, adding if that happens Delhi will face a &quot;double AAP-da&quot; (double disaster).Those who built a &#39;sheesh mahal&#39; for themselves and those who looted thousands of crores of public money can never think of the welfare of the poor, he said. &quot;That is why they are spreading lies in Delhi. These AAP-da people speak lies with such innocence that people get trapped.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;You may have heard of Charles Sobhraj, he was a known thug. He was such expert at duping with innocence that people would get trapped every time. That is why one has to remain cautious of such people,&quot; he said.Delhi now wants such a government that builds houses for the poor and makes the city modern, he said. &quot;A government that provides tap water to every house and freedom from the tanker mafia. That is why the whole of Delhi is saying today - February 5 will come, AAP will go, BJP will come,&quot; he said.Delhi goes to polls on February 5 and the results will be announced on February 8.&quot;When the BJP government is formed in Delhi on February 8, all the promises made to you will be fulfilled within the time limit. This is Modi&#39;s guarantee. Modi&#39;s guarantee means - guarantee of fulfilment of the guarantee,&quot; he told the gathering.&quot;I will take care of you like a family member, your dream will be my dream and I will put all efforts to fulfil your dreams. The BJP has a track record of fulfilling its promises,&quot; he said&nbsp;In his 50-minute speech, PM Modi also gave the slogan &quot;AAPda nahi sahenge, Delhi ko badal ke rahenge&quot;, urging people to bring about a change in Delhi.", "keywords": ["Arvind Kejriwal", "Haryana CM", "Nayab Singh Saini", "Yamuna water", "poisonous water", "achman", "ammonia contamination", "Delhi water", "BJP", "Haryana government"], "date": "2025-01-29T22:31:05+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125012901534", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:00:52"},

Kejriwal, BJP trade barbs ahead of Delhi polls 2025", "content": "With just days to go before the Delhi Assembly election, the war of words between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has intensified. Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has accused the BJP of &ldquo;mixing poison&rdquo; into the city&rsquo;s water supply in an alleged attempt to &ldquo;create chaos and shift blame&rdquo; to his administration.&nbsp;Addressing reporters on Monday, Kejriwal claimed the BJP, which governs Haryana, deliberately polluted the Yamuna river. &ldquo;The Haryana government has mixed poison in the water coming to Delhi from the Yamuna,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is only due to the vigilance of Delhi Jal Board engineers that this water was stopped at the border and didn&rsquo;t enter the city.&rdquo;&nbsp;Kejriwal likened the alleged act to wartime sabotage, accusing the BJP of risking Delhiites&rsquo; health for political gain. According to reports, the &ldquo;poison&rdquo; in question is ammonia, a recurring issue that has disrupted Delhi&rsquo;s water supply in the past.&nbsp;Delhi Jal Board CEO refutes claims&nbsp;Amid these allegations, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) CEO dismissed Kejriwal&rsquo;s statements as &ldquo;false&rdquo; and warned they could incite unnecessary fear. Delhi faces a daily water demand of over 3,000 million litres but receives only 2,000 million litres. High ammonia levels in the Yamuna have exacerbated this shortfall, a challenge AAP blames on Haryana&rsquo;s mismanagement.&nbsp;BJP hits back&nbsp;Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini called Kejriwal&rsquo;s allegations &ldquo;blatantly false and disgusting,&rdquo; threatening legal action. &ldquo;Kejriwal should apologise to the people of Haryana and Delhi for his statements. Otherwise, we will file a defamation suit,&rdquo; Saini told news agency ANI.&nbsp;Saini also accused Kejriwal of being a &ldquo;disaster for Delhi&rdquo; and predicted that voters would reject the AAP in the upcoming election. Labour Minister Anil Vij added, &ldquo;Arvind Kejriwal is a factory of lies. Let journalists and experts check the water quality where the Yamuna enters Delhi and compare it with water in Delhi. The truth will be clear.&rdquo;&nbsp;Election Commission steps in&nbsp;Amid the escalating feud, AAP leaders, including Delhi CM Atishi and Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, met with the Election Commission, demanding an inquiry. The poll body has sought a detailed report from the Haryana government by January 28.&nbsp;Yamuna&rsquo;s pollution and Delhi politics&nbsp;The cleanliness of the Yamuna has always been a hot-button issue in Delhi politics. Ahead of the 2020 election, Kejriwal had promised to transform the polluted river into a clean, drinkable water source, likening it to London&rsquo;s Thames.&nbsp;However, this promise remains unfulfilled. Last week, Kejriwal candidly admitted his failure to deliver on three key promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi&rsquo;s roads to &ldquo;European standards.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;I either fulfil my promises or admit when I fall short. Cleaning the Yamuna is one of the promises I couldn&rsquo;t keep,&rdquo; he said at a rally in Laxmi Bai Nagar.&nbsp;BJP&rsquo;s jibes and AAP&rsquo;s defence&nbsp;The BJP has seized on Kejriwal&rsquo;s admission. Union Home Minister Amit Shah mocked the AAP leader during a rally, saying, &ldquo;He promised to purify the Yamuna and even take a dip in it. Delhiites are still waiting for his world-famous dip.&rdquo;&nbsp;Shah further suggested Kejriwal could take a dip in the Ganga during the Mahakumbh to &ldquo;wash away his sins.&rdquo; Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath also weighed in, accusing Kejriwal of turning the Yamuna into a &ldquo;dirty drain.&rdquo;&nbsp;(With agency inputs)", "keywords": ["Yamuna pollution", "Kejriwal BJP clash", "Delhi Assembly elections 2025", "Delhi Jal Board", "Haryana water dispute", "ammonia in Yamuna", "AAP BJP feud", "Delhi polls news", "Election Commission inquiry", "Delhi elections"], "date": "2025-01-28T09:56:50+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125012800234", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:00:52"},

He also proposed to establish Common Effluent Treatment Plants in Panipat, Faridabad, Gurugram, and Yamunanagar.In his budget speech, the chief minister announced Rs 5,666.28 crore allocation for the Urban Local Bodies, a 38.5 per cent increase from Rs 4,091.95 crore allocated this fiscal.Saini, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said that to empower local governments, the municipal corporations, councils and municipal Committees will be granted the authority to determine taxes and fees.These local bodies will have the flexibility to set taxes such as property tax, development tax and charges like garbage charges, advertisement charges, and water and sewer fees within the range of the minimum and maximum rates prescribed by the state government, he said.According to the policy of the Urban Local Bodies Department, priority will be given to cooperatives formed by women and members of the Scheduled Castes in tenders for sanitation works, the chief minister told the Assembly.To provide more opportunities to women, Saini proposed to allot one-third of the tenders for canteens in government institutions, panchayats, urban local bodies, educational institutions, and other government buildings to women self-help groups on a priority basis.&quot;The old areas of all big cities which are haphazardly settled will be redeveloped,&quot; he said.For this, the state government will upgrade the road infrastructure to meet international standards, focusing on the needs of all and with a particular emphasis on making roads pedestrian-friendly, Saini said, adding that a 1,000-km Right of Way will be developed in the first phase.The chief minister said his government is committed to providing better sanitation, street cleaning, sewerage maintenance, road repairs, and gardening services in a faster and more efficient manner by equipping municipal committees with the necessary machinery and equipment.On the lines of the multi-level parking facilities built in Rohtak and Gurugram, similar structures will be constructed in all major cities of the state to address parking issues and improve traffic management, he said.The chief minister informed the house that the state government would develop ultra-modern parks for persons with special abilities.Saini announced the formation of an Industry Labour Friendly Council, which will be chaired by him to provide further momentum to industrial development.Out of 101 lakh metric tonnes of garbage from 75 old sites, approximately 69 lakh metric tonnes has been disposed of scientifically and 109 acres of land has been reclaimed over the last 10 years, the chief minister said.This land is now being used to build green areas, parks, and community infrastructure, he said, adding the government has set a target of 100 per cent cleaning of all old garbage sites by the 2025-26 fiscal.During his over two-and-a-half hours long speech, Saini also said the Haryana government will sign an agreement with the World Bank for technical and financial assistance under which an investment of Rs 3,647 crore will be made over the next six years to combat air pollution.He proposed to develop a new policy for effective e-waste management.Under Haryana&#39;s Enterprise and Employment Policy, industrial units that adopt zero-waste disposal processes and excel in promoting the circular economy will receive special recognition and support, Saini said.The Haryana government will focus on raising awareness and developing skills in this area, he said.To turn this concept into reality, the government will collaborate with private companies as well as national and international organizations to adopt and implement the best global practices, the chief minister said.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has placed significant emphasis on the concept of the circular economy.Saini said that every effort will be made to begin the construction of an international-level Aravalli Jungle Safari on 10,000 acres of land in Gurugram and Nuh districts as soon as possible.

To secure water conservation for the future, we need to advance in water storage by making various plans and experimenting with different methods,&quot; said the Union Minister.Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini was also present at the occassion, according to an official release.The Union Minister said that, due to the visionary leadership of the prime minister, the growing problem of water scarcity has been mitigated.Under the leadership of PM Modi, 25 lakh women in the country were trained to check the quality of water coming into their villages and homes and they were provided with kits for the same.However, during the 70 years of Congress rule, there was never a need to train anyone, as the government never provided water to people&#39;s homes, he alleged.Women had to fetch water from distant places, and the water was often not even fit for drinking, he said, adding that it was impossible for them to be concerned about the quality of the water.He said that under the Jal Jeevan Mission, the Har Ghar Jal scheme provides 55 liters of water per person.He further stated that if the underground water is completely used up, there will be no water left for future generations, so it is essential to store rainwater.Patil said the Prime Minister believes that water for villages should stay in villages, and water for fields should stay in fields.For this, the Ministry of Jal Shakti has developed different designs, and work will also be carried out on these in Haryana, he added.In his address, Patil mentioned that to ensure Haryana receives its rightful share of water, a meeting with the chief ministers of the concerned states will be held in the coming days to resolve inter-state water issues.Once these issues are resolved, Haryana will receive the water it is entitled to, he said.Patil remarked that Haryana is a progressive state that depends on other states for its water supply.It also receives less rainfall. In such a state, it is necessary for both the government and citizens to be concerned about ensuring that there is no water shortage in the future, said Patil.Therefore, with public participation, both the central and Haryana governments will work together in a committed manner to solve the problem of water scarcity in the state, said the Union Minister.Haryana CM Saini called upon every Haryanvi to take a pledge to save every single drop of water and prevent its misuse.He encouraged people to become Jal Mitras and contribute to the success of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain 2025 campaign.Saini emphasized that the initiative would be a milestone in the efforts being taken for water conservation.He assured that the 2.8 crore people of Haryana would leave no stone unturned in ensuring the success of this water conservation movement.Welcoming Patil to the sacred land of Lord Shri Krishna, the CM expressed his gratitude to the PM for choosing Haryana to launch this nationwide campaign.Saini said that water conservation is not just a campaign but a movement and a revolution.He stressed that this initiative is not merely a government scheme but a crucial step for securing the future of the coming generations.The CM said when Neeti, Niyat aur Netratav (policy, intent, and leadership) are right, society also undergoes transformation, and PM Modi has proven this to be true.He emphasised how the PM has addressed social issues and shown deep concern for the people, leading to nationwide movements on cleanliness, health, Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao, and water conservation, which have now become mass campaigns.He said Modi has set nine resolutions for a sustainable future, with water conservation being the first.He stressed the importance of this initiative, pointing out that India has only 4 percent of the world&#39;s total fresh water while 18 percent of the world&#39;s population lives here.He further emphasized that the Jal Shakti Abhiyan is crucial not only for the present generation but also for future generations.By conserving, storing, and using water wisely today, we can ensure sufficient resources for the generations to come. The core message of this campaign is to enhance public participation and awareness in water conservation and management, said Saini.Saini said Haryana does not have abundant water resources.The state is dependent on other states or groundwater, both of which have their limitations, he added.However, a third source -- rainwater harvesting and conservation -- offers a solution. To address this, the Haryana government has already launched several water conservation schemes, covering sectors such as agriculture, industry, and housing, he stated.", "keywords": ["water conservation", "Union Jal Shakti Minister", "CR Patil", "Nayab Singh Saini", "water conservation campaign", "Haryana", "Panchkula"], "date": "2025-03-22T21:38:14+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125032200821", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:00:52"},

Haryana&#39;s soil embodies a unique confluence of valour, creativity and tradition,&quot; said Saini.Its folk art, music and dance are renowned across the world for their authenticity and vibrancy, he added.The chief minister said this festival stands as a living demonstration to the proud legacy of Haryanvi cinema.Haryana holds a distinct identity not only as a political and administrative entity, but also as a land of cultural richness, natural beauty, valor, tradition and self-respect, said Saini.This sacred soil has produced warriors and athletes of great renown, while also making invaluable contributions to the realms of music and culture, he added.The chief minister further said cinema is not just a source of entertainment, but also a powerful medium for social transformation and public awareness.Haryanvi cinema, he said, has played a crucial role in preserving traditions, inspiring progressive thinking and awakening societal consciousness.Describing cinema as a powerful medium to influence the younger generation, Saini emphasized the need to engage youth through positive and inspiring themes.He urged the celebrities from the film industry to take the lead in this endeavour.The chief minister said while film festivals have traditionally been organised in cities like Goa and Pune, hosting such a festival in Haryana is a bold and forward-looking initiative.It marks a significant step towards establishing Haryana&#39;s distinct presence in the world of cinema, he said.Saini expressed confidence that the festival would inspire greater awareness and interest in cinema among the new generation of viewers and aspiring artists.Describing the event as a vibrant confluence of art, culture and film, he said that this initiative would contribute to shaping a new and stronger cultural identity for Haryana on the national stage.Meanwhile, actor Raj Kumar Rao praised the Haryana Film Festival 2025, calling it a significant platform that will empower and inspire young talent to pursue careers in the film industry.Sharing his personal journey, the actor recalled that when he aspired to enter the film world, there were no such opportunities and platforms.He urged today&#39;s youth to take full advantage of such initiatives to refine and showcase their talent.Rao said India has emerged as a prominent force globally, with countries around the world looking toward India with admiration and interest especially in the field of cinema, where new opportunities and dimensions are rapidly unfolding.Encouraging the youth, he said, &quot;If you pursue your passion with dedication, hard work and sincerity, success will surely follow.&quot;", "keywords": ["Haryana film city", "Haryana", "Pinjore", "Nayab Singh Saini", "Panchkula"], "date": "2025-04-05T20:30:30+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040500749", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:00:56"},

Somnath Bharti won the 2020 elections from the constituency with an 18,000-vote margin. This year, BJP and Congress mounted serious challenges, making it a three-way contest.

Expect a YouTube video titled something like &ldquo;I Contested Elections. It Did Not Go Well.&rdquo;&nbsp;Does this mean the end of his political aspirations? Not necessarily.

The resulting congestion led to some individuals being pushed and falling, causing injuries, while others trampled over them in the chaos that followed.&nbsp;Overcrowding on foot-over-bridgesAccording to the inquiry, after the Shiv Ganga Express departed from platform 12, a large crowd of passengers quickly gathered, resulting in overcrowding on the foot-over bridges. The station director, recognising the situation&rsquo;s severity, ordered a halt to the sale of additional tickets to prevent further overcrowding.&nbsp;In a statement to The Indian Express, Northern Railways&rsquo; Chief Public Relations Officer, Upadhyay, explained that the initial confusion was caused by the assumption that the Prayagraj Express would arrive at platform 14, prompting a large number of passengers to gather there.&nbsp;This group, consisting mostly of reserved ticket holders, was subsequently mixed with other passengers who had planned to board the train.

The tremors were felt across Delhi-NCR and nearby states.According to the NCS report, the earthquake occurred due to movement along a weak underground zone, known as a lineament, which runs in a northwest-southeast direction.This zone has structural variations that build up stress over time, leading to quakes.Mishra said the region has a history of small to moderate earthquakes, with the strongest in recent memory being a 4.6 magnitude quake in 2007, about 6 km from Monday&#39;s epicenter.&quot;Today&#39;s quake was caused by &quot;normal faulting&quot;, a type of ground movement often linked to underground water or past river deposits weakening the rocks,&quot; the NCS chief said.The shaking was strongest in areas with soft soil, like Lodhi Road, where the ground movement was amplified.Delhi is placed in seismic zone IV in the seismic zoning map of India, the second highest in the country.Delhi region in northern India experiences frequent tremors due to both far-field and near-field earthquakes from the Himalayan and local sources, respectively.The national capital region is exposed to moderate to high risk seismic activity due to Himalayan earthquakes such as the 7.5 magnitude Garhwal Himalaya quake in 1803, 6.8 magnitude Uttarkashi earthquake in 1991, 6.6 magnitude Chamoli earthquake in 1999, 7.8 magnitude Gorkha earthquake in 2015 and a few moderate earthquakes from the Hindukush region.Local earthquakes recorded in the region include 6.5 magnitude Delhi earthquake in 1720, 5 magnitude Mathura earthquake in 1842, 6.7 magnitude Bulandshahar earthquake in 1956 and 5.8 magnitude Moradabad earthquake in 1966.", "keywords": ["Delhi earthquake", "weak rock layers", "National Centre for Seismology", "normal faulting", "seismic activity", "Dhaula Kuan", "earthquake magnitude", "seismic zone IV", "tremors in Delhi", "local earthquakes"], "date": "2025-02-17T17:58:57+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021700795", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:01:00"},

However, after an announcement was made, people started rushing, and those who fell were crushed,&quot; the relative said.Among the victims was a woman travelling with her family to Chhapra in Bihar. Her son, struggling to hold back his tears, recounted the devastating loss.&quot;We were travelling home in a large group and my mother lost her life in the chaos.

The 15 million registered voters here can&rsquo;t compare to the billion eligible nationally. But they will judge whether a once-promising alternative model of Indian politics deserves another chance.&nbsp;About a decade ago, a new political force &mdash; the Aam Aadmi Party, led by a maverick anti-corruption crusader named Arvind Kejriwal &mdash; stormed into office in Delhi, pledging to clean up politics and transform governance. It had then been ruled for 15 years by the old-world grandees of the Congress Party. But successive winters of protests over corruption, inflation, and the safety of women had eroded the venerable party&rsquo;s hold on the city. Kejriwal, who led some of those protests, became a middle-class hero as a consequence. He rode that reputation into the chief minister&rsquo;s office in Delhi.&nbsp;Many believe that Delhi is a microcosm of the nation &mdash; only not of India today, but of its future. It is relatively well off, and its citizens more demanding. Residents hail from all over, and appeals to caste, ethnic and regional identity that work elsewhere are&nbsp; less effective here. Delhi seemed like the best place for a new politics, organized around service delivery, governance reform and grassroots accountability, to take hold.&nbsp;This was what Kejriwal assured the country he would provide. He would succeed in India&rsquo;s most future-focused city &mdash; and then, one by one, other enclaves of prosperity and progress would fall to the Aam Aadmi Party, whose name in Hindi means &ldquo;Common Man.&rdquo; Eventually, it would displace Congress as the principal opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even Kejriwal can claim he has fulfilled those hopes. In the decade-plus that AAP has dominated this city&rsquo;s politics, India&rsquo;s gross domestic product has increased more than threefold. Delhi is not three times as liveable. If anything, it is a more difficult city than it was under the Congress. It has the worst air quality in the world; it is running out of water; and there may be fewer bus routes than there were in 2013.&nbsp;Those are big failures, but they could have been forgiven if the AAP government had at least stuck to the basics. The governance ideology it championed was organized around radical decentralization and grassroots participation. In a country where state schools are run by unaccountable bureaucrats and local public health systems are barely present, Kejriwal promised local management committees for schools and community-run clinics.&nbsp;That seemed to work initially. Elections were held for school boards for the first time and patients seemed satisfied by the free primary care at community clinics. But results haven&rsquo;t held up over time; drop-out rates are higher than the national average, and the clinics have been embroiled in scandals over sub-standard medicines.&nbsp;Worse, the focus on decentralization has come at the expense of world-class facilities. Delhi has about as many hospitals as it did a decade ago, although incomes and its population have risen. Transport infrastructure, other than the independently-run Metro, is no better than it was, and the city comes to a halt every time it gets a couple of inches of rain.&nbsp;Kejriwal, with some justice, blames some of these failures on the Modi-led federal apparatus. Indeed, he was jailed last year, along with other top party leaders, over allegations (which they&#39;ve denied) of a liquor excise scam. It certainly looks to most observers as if his government and its programs have been specifically targeted by Modi&rsquo;s government. But the average voter, even if she knows this, doesn&rsquo;t care: Many Indians believe that part of a chief minister&rsquo;s job is to get along with the prime minister well enough to intercede on behalf of his state&rsquo;s residents.&nbsp;But that was never AAP&rsquo;s game plan. Rather than demonstrate to the country that they were better administrators than Modi, they prioritized their geographical expansion outside Delhi. After successive failures in various other relatively urban states, they displaced the Congress from its northern stronghold of Punjab in 2022. This single-minded effort alienated other opposition parties and left them facing the BJP&rsquo;s ire without friends or allies.&nbsp;For a party with a hold on the politics of just two of India&rsquo;s states, the AAP still talks a big game. Kejriwal said on Jan. 26 that this election featured a choice between the BJP&rsquo;s ideology of cronyism and his model of &ldquo;free electricity, education, health care, and transport.&rdquo; This is a bit unfair given the Delhi BJP has released a long list of subsidies and giveaways it will somehow pay for if elected.&nbsp;Still, if free stuff is all the AAP is reduced to, that is failure enough. The party&rsquo;s pledges in this election &mdash; a salary for Hindu and Sikh priests, foreign education for students from underprivileged castes, weddings arranged for the daughters of those who drive Delhi&rsquo;s ubiquitous three-wheelers &mdash; sound like they&rsquo;re throwing the populist kitchen sink at this vote. It does not set them apart from any other party, let alone Modi&rsquo;s, which prides itself on welfare programs.&nbsp;Kejriwal may yet win another term in Delhi; he remains personally popular with its residents. But a decade of prioritising his national ambitions over implementation has destroyed his chance of emerging as the progressive alternative to Modi.&nbsp; (Disclaimer: This is a Bloomberg Opinion piece, and these are the personal opinions of the writer.

Meanwhile, the BJP, riding high on recent victories in Haryana and Maharashtra, is looking to gain ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Congress, a part of the INDIA bloc along with AAP at the national level, is also vying to revive its influence in the capital, where it once dominated the political landscape. &nbsp;&nbsp;With 699 candidates in the fray across 70 constituencies, the elections will serve as a referendum on AAP&rsquo;s governance, while also shaping the future of BJP and Congress in Delhi for the next five years.

Kejriwal has been vocal against rising crime rates in Delhi, promising enhanced security funding for residents&#39; welfare associations if re-elected, positioning himself as a protector of public safety. His governance model has been praised for economic management, making him a strong contender against rivals BJP and the Congress.&nbsp;Atishi (Kalkaji)Delhi Chief Minister Atishi will contest from Kalkaji against BJP&rsquo;s Ramesh Bidhuri. Atishi has been a significant figure in education reforms in the national capital.

As the current Chief Minister, she has taken charge following Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation, showcasing her capability to lead during challenging times. Her candidacy from the Kalkaji seat is significant, as she aims for re-election against notable rivals, including BJP&rsquo;s Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress&rsquo;s Alka Lamba.

He is a prominent candidate in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections due to his significant political experience and leadership within the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). As a state minister, he has been a key figure in implementing AAP&rsquo;s policies, particularly in education and health, which resonate with voters. His candidacy from the Greater Kailash constituency, a high-profile area, underscores his importance to AAP&rsquo;s strategy to retain power in Delhi. Bharadwaj&rsquo;s active engagement in addressing local issues and his critical stance against opposition parties position him as a vital asset for AAP in the competitive electoral landscape of 2025.&nbsp;Gopal Rai (Babarpur)Gopal Rai is a pivotal candidate in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, representing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) from the Babarpur constituency. As Delhi&#39;s Environment Minister and AAP&rsquo;s Delhi Convenor, he has a strong political background, having won the Babarpur seat twice, including a significant victory in 2020 against the BJP by over 33,000 votes. His leadership is crucial as AAP aims to maintain its dominance in Delhi, especially after winning 62 out of 70 seats in the last elections. Rai&rsquo;s commitment to contest independently without alliances underlines AAP&#39;s strategy to reinforce its grassroots support ahead of the February 5, 2025 elections.&nbsp;Rajesh Gupta (Wazirpur)Rajesh Gupta, who will contest from Wazirpur, is a significant candidate in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections due to his extensive political experience and strong grassroots connections. As a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), he has been actively involved in local governance and community issues, enhancing his visibility among constituents.

He will play a prominent role in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections due to his role within the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and his tenure as Delhi&rsquo;s Health Minister. His leadership in managing public health initiatives, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, has garnered him considerable recognition. Jain was granted bail in October 2024 after spending 18 months in jail in connection with a money laundering case.Delhi Assembly elections: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)The BJP has announced its first list of 29 candidates, aiming to reclaim power after over two decades of non-BJP rule in Delhi.&nbsp;Key candidates include:&nbsp;Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma (New Delhi)Parvesh Verma will be contesting against Arvind Kejriwal from the New Delhi constituency.&nbsp; As the incumbent Member of Parliament for West Delhi, he has demonstrated strong electoral performance, notably winning the 2019 elections by the largest margin in Delhi&rsquo;s history &mdash; over 578,000 votes. His political lineage, being the son of former Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma, enhances his visibility and credibility among voters. Verma&rsquo;s experience on key parliamentary committees, including Finance and Estimates, further underscores his capability to address legislative challenges effectively.&nbsp;Ramesh Bidhuri (Kalkaji)The BJP has fielded Ramesh Bidhuri against Atishi from the Kalkaji seat. His recent remarks targetting Atishi and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi have ignited significant media coverage and public discourse, making him a focal point of political debates. Despite facing potential replacement discussions within the BJP due to backlash from his comments, his candidacy reflects the party&rsquo;s strategy of leveraging provocative figures to galvanise voter interest.&nbsp;Kailash Gahlot (Bijwasan)Kailash Gahlot is a key candidate in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, representing the BJP from the Bijwasan constituency. He is a significant candidate in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections due to his recent shift from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). His decision to leave AAP, citing that political ambitions overshadowed the party&rsquo;s commitment to the people, positions him as a critical voice against his former party, which has dominated Delhi politics since 2015. Contesting from Bijwasan, Gahlot&rsquo;s experience and insights into AAP&rsquo;s strategies could provide the BJP with a strategic advantage in challenging AAP&rsquo;s stronghold.Delhi Assembly polls 2025: CongressThe Congress in Tuesday released its second list of 26 candidates for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, increasing the total number of declared candidates for the 70-seat legislature to 47.&nbsp;Sandeep Dikshit (New Delhi)Sandeep Dikshit, who has been fielded from the New Delhi seat is a significant candidate in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections due to his political lineage and experience.

They feel that the Constitution and democracy are nothing. They think since people have elected them, they are the rulers like the Mughals. This is not appropriate in a democratic system...&quot; Gautam told ANI.Earlier, Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva slammed former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and said his name is &quot;synonymous with lies&quot; as he &quot;failed&#39; to fulfil any of his promises.Taking a jibe at the AAP national convenor, Sachdeva said that the only statement of his which turned true was his party members including him, going to jail.&quot;Arvind Kejriwal had said that I swear on my children that I will not take any government car, bungalow or security. Arvind Kejriwal should tell whose life was lost and whose promise was lost.

The area is also home to landmarks like the Lotus Temple and the ISKCON Temple in East of Kailash.The constituency is marked by two contrasting sides: one that is clean and developed, and the other burdened by traffic, pollution, narrow lanes, congested roads, potholes, and inadequate sewerage systems.A lane with an open garbage dump next to a park near the Nehru Enclave Metro Station is a major eyesore for the residents and visitors.Meena Sharma, a resident of Govindpuri near Kalkaji, told PTI, &quot;We have to drive on roads filled with potholes, and streets with dumped garbage bags and sewage water. It&#39;s a mess, and sanitation work hasn&#39;t been carried out in a long time.&quot;&nbsp;Basic civic amenities remain a challenge in Kalkaji, with issues such as overflowing garbage, poor sanitation, poorly maintained parks, and blocked drains persisting. The sewers in particular lack adequate capacity for water flow, causing frequent overflows onto the roads.&quot;There are two sides to this constituency -- one that appears clean and well-maintained, and the other that struggles with neglected infrastructure,&quot; said Harbansal Lal, a 47-year-old resident of Kalkaji who owns a shop in the A-block Kalkaji market.&quot;The drainage systems have long-standing issues as water fails to pass through properly, often spilling onto the roads. These problems have remained unchanged for years,&quot; he added.Sanjay Rawat, a retired government employee and a resident of Sant Nagar opposite the ISKCON temple, said traffic snarls remain a major concern for the area.&quot;Every year during festivals, the traffic situation here is unbearable. The jams are so severe that you can&#39;t take out your vehicle, hail a cab, or even find a rickshaw. We often have to walk for more than two km to escape the snarls,&quot; Rawat said.He added, &quot;We cannot completely blame the government for this issue but strict traffic and civic management are the need of the hour.&quot;&nbsp;Asked about the issues he would vote on, 55-year-old Dev Raj Swami, who resides near the Kalkaji Metro Station, said, &quot;The problem is that every political party is indulging in blame game instead of fulfilling their responsibilities.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;There is no coordination, and no one takes accountability for any work. This election, we will vote for basic issues like cleanliness, traffic management, and pollution, as these critical problems urgently need attention,&quot; he added.Another resident of Kalkaji, an auto driver named Ravi, shared his perspective, &quot;By the grace of Maa Kalka, everything is fine here&quot;.Referring to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Ravi said, &quot;At least they are trying, so we still have hope. Their focus on health and education will benefit the young generation.&quot;&nbsp;The residents also said that the contest is between the BJP and the AAP with the Congress not posing a major challenge.AAP won Kalkaji in the last two elections and is aiming for a hat-trick in next month&#39;s polls. In the 2020 elections, Atishi won the seat, defeating BJP&#39;s Dharambir Singh by a margin of 11,393 votes, while Congress candidate Shivani Chopra came third.This time, Atishi is facing Bidhuri, a former South Delhi MP who has also served as a three-time MLA from Tughlakabad, winning elections in 2003, 2008, and 2013.The Delhi election is scheduled for February 5, with the results to be announced on February 8.", "keywords": ["Delhi polls", "Kalkaji constituency", "traffic jams", "civic amenities", "Atishi", "BJP", "Ramesh Bidhuri", "Alka Lamba", "infrastructure", "sanitation", "pollution", "AAP", "election issues"], "date": "2025-01-15T16:55:14+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125011500861", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:01:18"},

If Modi&#39;s guarantee was real, this scheme should have been approved yesterday. But the first decision taken by newly appointed CM Rekha Gupta was to betray that promise, the Kalkaji MLA alleged.Displaying posters featuring Modi and Gupta, she asked, &quot;When will this amount be credited to their accounts? Was this just another election gimmick?&quot;&nbsp;Both the AAP and the BJP promised monthly financial assistance to women ahead of the elections and it has been a much-discussed issue during the campaign.A day after AAP was ousted from power in Delhi on February 8, party supremo Arvind Kejriwal met the party&#39;s 22 newly elected MLAs at his residence.Following the meeting, Atishi said the AAP will ensure that the BJP pays Rs 2,500 per month to women by March 8 as promised by it, provides 300 units of free electricity and continues other facilities for the people.At the press conference on Friday, when asked about the new government&#39;s decision to table 14 CAG reports in the next assembly session, Atishi dismissed it as &quot;routine work.&quot;When I was CM, I also sent the CAG report to Ram Niwas. It is part of the process,&quot; she said.The BJP government said it will table the CAG reports &quot;against the performance of AAP government&quot; in the assembly in the session that will begin on Monday.BJP&#39;s Rekha Gupta was sworn-in as Delhi CM and six other MLAs were inducted into her cabinet on Thursday.At its maiden meeting on Thursday, the newly-formed Delhi Cabinet approved the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme in the capital, discussed Mahila Samriddhi Yojna, and also decided to table 14 pending CAG reports in the first session of the eighth Assembly.", "keywords": ["Delhi government", "Rekha Gupta", "Atishi", "BJP", "AAP", "Aam Aadmi Party"], "date": "2025-02-21T06:45:04+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022100044", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:01:30"},

She highlighted several incidents of unfair treatment, urging the Speaker to address these concerns to restore democratic norms in the House.Atishi in her scathing criticism of the Speaker&#39;s role, stated, &quot;In a parliamentary democracy, the Speaker serves as the impartial custodian of legislative debate.&quot;She emphasized that it was the Speaker&#39;s responsibility to maintain decorum, ensure every voice was heard, and uphold the principles of fairness.She argued that under Gupta&#39;s leadership, these responsibilities were ignored, and actions were taken that were &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;blatantly partisan.&quot;One of Atishi&#39;s primary grievances was the allocation of speaking time. She argued that during the previous session, opposition MLAs were given significantly less time to speak compared to BJP members.&quot;While BJP MLAs were granted ample speaking time, some even speaking uninterrupted for more than 20 minutes, opposition MLAs, including myself, were restricted to just 3-4 minutes each,&quot; she said.She referred to the discussion on the CAG report, where the BJP had 18 speakers who spoke for a total of 190 minutes, while the opposition, with only five speakers, was given a mere 33 minutes. Atishi argued that this was not in proportion to the number of seats held by each party in the Assembly.&quot;According to the proportion of our seats, the AAP should have received 32 per cent of the speaking time, yet we were allotted only 14 per cent,&quot; she noted. &quot;This imbalance severely undermines the ability of the opposition to effectively participate in legislative debates.&quot;Atishi also pointed out the disparity in how the Speaker handled disruptions and the behavior of members in the House. She claimed that opposition MLAs were subjected to punitive measures when they raised their voices or expressed dissent, but no action was taken against ruling party members who engaged in similar or worse behavior.&quot;During the LG&#39;s address on 25.02.2025, both opposition and ruling party MLAs raised slogans. The opposition raised &#39;Jai Bheem&#39;, while the ruling party chanted &#39;Modi, Modi, Modi.&#39; While all opposition MLAs were marshalled out, not a single ruling party MLA faced any consequences for their actions,&quot; Atishi stated.&quot;Such actions create a sense of inequality, as it is clear that the Speaker is favoring one side over the other.&quot;Furthermore, Atishi raised concerns about the unprecedented denial of access to the Assembly premises for opposition MLAs.&quot;For the first time in the history of the Delhi Assembly, opposition MLAs were barred from entering the Assembly premises after being suspended,&quot; she stated. &quot;When we tried to enter on February 26, we were stopped by a large contingent of police officers.&quot; Atishi argued that this action violated parliamentary norms, as the suspension of an MLA typically only extends to the House&#39;s precincts, not the entire Assembly premises.&quot;Rule 277 of the Rules of Procedure clearly states that suspension applies only to the Assembly Hall and related areas, not the lawns or the Leader of Opposition&#39;s office,&quot; she said. &quot;Despite our protests, the Speaker refused to rectify this blatant illegality, which is without precedent in independent India.&quot;In her letter, Atishi also criticized the Speaker for his failure to intervene when ruling party members used offensive language in the House.&quot;BJP MLAs repeatedly used words such as &#39;chor,&#39; &#39;neech,&#39; and &#39;gunde&#39; during the proceedings. Yet, the Speaker did nothing to stop this,&quot; she wrote. &quot;However, when I quoted data from the CAG&#39;s report, you asked for the facts to be struck off the record. This double standard is unacceptable and goes against the impartial nature expected of a Speaker.&quot; Atishi further emphasized that during her speech, she was interrupted repeatedly by the Speaker, who also switched off her microphone in the middle of her address.&quot;As the Leader of the Opposition, I should be allowed sufficient time to present my views, but instead, my voice was silenced, and the ruling party&#39;s disruptions went unchecked.&quot;Atishi also brought up the issue of the Speaker&#39;s failure to treat both parties equally in matters of decorum and parliamentary procedure.&quot;Whenever the ruling party created a ruckus during the speech of an opposition MLA, the Speaker did not take any action. But when an opposition MLA deviated slightly from the topic, they were immediately interrupted,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Such actions show that the Speaker is acting in a partisan manner, instead of being impartial as required by the Constitution.&quot;Atishi made several demands aimed at ensuring fairness and restoring respect for democratic processes. She requested that suspended MLAs be allowed to remain in the premises and peacefully protest in the Assembly lawns, that future sessions ensure a fair allocation of speaking time-based on the number of MLAs in each party, and that the Speaker apply the same standards to both the ruling and opposition parties regarding disorderly behavior. &quot;A functioning democracy requires a Speaker who is impartial and who fosters fairness in the House,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I urge you to restore fairness and respect in the upcoming Budget session.", "keywords": ["Aam Aadmi Party", "Delhi Legislative Assembly", "Vijender Gupta", "Atishi Marlena", "8th Delhi Assembly", "Jai Bheem", "Modi", "Assembly Hall", "leader", "Atishi", "BJP", "India", "Speaker", "Aaam Aadmi party", "impartial custodian"], "date": "2025-03-12T14:34:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125031200460", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:01:33"},

We will collect all data of CCTV footage and announcements done during that time,&quot; a police source said.Hospital sources said all bodies of victims were handed over to their family members by 9 am on Sunday.Some sources said most family members took the bodies of their loved ones without getting a postmortem, however, there was no official confirmation of this.", "keywords": ["Delhi stampede", "traumatic asphyxia", "railway station", "victims", "RML Hospital", "post-mortem", "New Delhi Railway Station", "Maha Kumbh", "compensation", "inquiry"], "date": "2025-02-16T18:09:20+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021600451", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:01:33"},

Hundreds of apps have been banned, several smartphone makers have been served with tax evasion notices and telecom firms have been kept out of 5G trials. In our first segment, Ayush Mishra dwells into details to find out why are Chinese companies under scrutiny in India?&nbsp;After China, let us now move on to a much-awaited annual event. The two-day Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit is starting from October 30. It will feature prominent voices from India&rsquo;s economic, financial, and corporate landscape, including RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, IRDAI Chairman Debasish Panda, Sebi wholetime member Ananth Narayan, Jio Financial Services Chairman K V Kamath, SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara and PhonePE CEO Sameer Nigam. For an international perspective, the summit will also have global head of equity strategy at Jefferies Christopher Wood. The summit comes at a time when India&rsquo;s digital banking infrastructure is expanding at a very fast clip and its economy is projected to become the third largest in a matter of years. However, challenges are mounting too. Against this backdrop, join A K Bhattacharya, Tamal Bandyopadhyay and Ruchika Chitravanshi to find out what to expect from this summit and why you cannot afford to miss it.&nbsp;One of the challenges that the experts just spoke about was global uncertainty. It is singeing Indian equity markets too. Key indices have been in a free fall over the past couple of days with the BSE Sensex index crashing 900 points on Thursday, and the Nifty50 index nearing 18,850-mark. The markets are at their lowest levels in 4 months. With them, shares India&rsquo;s most valuable company, Reliance Industries, too, have lost ground as they dropped 4% in 5 days. Analysts believe volatility in the commodity market, coupled with heavy capex plans, have been weighing on the stock. So, will the company&rsquo;s September quarter results help it come out of its slumber? Or will it trigger another round of sell-off? What are the markets expecting from RIL&rsquo;s Q2 results?&nbsp;&nbsp;After the markets, let us see what is happening on domestic front. It seems, caste survey in Bihar has changed the course of country&rsquo;s election narrative. But some believe that the ruling BJP could implement Rohini Commission&rsquo;s report to turn the table on opposition. But what is this commission?

Party officials confirmed his nomination on Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My priority will be to present the pending Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) reports in the Assembly, which were delayed by the previous AAP government,&quot; Gupta told news agency PTI. &nbsp;&nbsp;Gupta and other BJP MLAs had earlier approached the court, alleging that the AAP-led Delhi government was deliberately withholding 14 CAG reports related to its governance. &nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Vijender Gupta?&nbsp;Vijender Gupta has been a well-known figure in Delhi politics. In the recently-held elections, he won from Rohini by a margin of over 37,000 votes, defeating AAP candidate Pradeep Mittal. The BJP secured 48 seats in the newly formed 8th Delhi Assembly, while AAP won 22. The Speaker of the Assembly is elected by the members of the House.&nbsp;Born on August 14, 1963, Gupta studied at Shri Ram College of Commerce. His political career began in 1980 with the Janata Vidyarthi Morcha. He later became the president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in 1995. &nbsp;&nbsp;His electoral journey started in 1997 when he was elected as a councillor in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Over the years, he held various key positions, including Chairman of the Law & General Purpose Committee and Deputy Chairman of the House Tax Committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;Despite BJP&rsquo;s heavy defeat in the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, where the party won only three seats, Gupta managed to retain his Rohini constituency. He also won in 2020, defeating AAP&rsquo;s Rajesh Nama &lsquo;Bansiwala&rsquo; by over 12,000 votes, and secured another victory in 2025 with the highest margin among BJP candidates. He won his Rohini seat by a margin of over 37,000 votes, defeating Pradeep Mittal of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).&nbsp;Vijender Gupta&#39;s stand against AAP government &nbsp;&nbsp;One of Gupta&rsquo;s significant political moves was raising concerns about the delay in presenting CAG reports under the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government. He and his colleagues took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the reports were intentionally withheld. &nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Delhi High Court ordered that the 14 pending reports be tabled in the Assembly. Justice Sachin Datta criticised the delay, saying that the reports should have been submitted for discussion in the House much earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;In the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP used this issue to accuse AAP of hiding financial irregularities, shaping a political narrative that influenced the election results against Kejriwal&rsquo;s party. &nbsp;&nbsp;Controversies surrounding Vijender Gupta &nbsp;Over the years, Gupta has been involved in multiple controversies. &nbsp;&nbsp;- 2009 Lok Sabha Elections: Congress leader Kapil Sibal accused him of violating the model code of conduct during the Chandni Chowk elections. Sibal claimed Gupta&rsquo;s wife misled senior citizens by attributing a pension hike to her husband while holding his campaign poster. Gupta denied the allegations, calling them an attempt to distract voters. &nbsp;&nbsp;- AAP allegations in 2024: In October 2024, AAP leaders filed police complaints against him, accusing him of caste-based discrimination and assaulting a female bus marshal. In response, Gupta also filed an FIR against AAP members for misconduct. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Vijender Gupta", "Delhi Assembly Speaker", "BJP Delhi", "Rohini MLA", "Delhi politics", "AAP vs BJP", "CAG reports Delhi", "Delhi Assembly elections", "Vijender Gupta BJP", "Delhi government", "Arvind Kejriwal", "Delhi High Court", "Delhi legislative assembly", "BJP leadership", "political controversies", "pro-tem speaker", "Delhi news", "Vijender Gupta biography", "Delhi elections 2025", "BJP candidates"], "date": "2025-02-20T16:53:08+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022000724", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:01:48"},

With the success in Delhi adding to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance&rsquo;s (NDA) recent triumphs in Haryana and Maharashtra, the stakes are high as the party aims to carry this momentum into the upcoming Bihar elections.&nbsp;The Delhi victory has given the NDA a significant boost, with political discussions already gaining pace in Bihar. The NDA has set an ambitious goal of winning 225 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly. With the alliance&rsquo;s leadership now firmly under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the NDA is rallying to showcase unity and strength ahead of the elections. Rajeev Ranjan, JD(U) national spokesperson, stressed that the victory in Delhi sends a message of the NDA&#39;s robust unity under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. &quot;The NDA is on track to win 225 seats,&quot; he added.&nbsp;In the lead-up to the elections, party leaders are striving to ensure cohesion among the alliance members. Joint meetings are being organised in each district, where state presidents of the NDA visit together to drive home the message of unity and determination.

Other key proposals include pensions for vulnerable groups and job creation for the youth, along with measures to curb migration.&nbsp;Despite RJD&#39;s aggressive campaigning, the NDA remains confident.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman&rsquo;s budget announcement earlier this year included several initiatives aimed at boosting Bihar&rsquo;s infrastructure and economy. These include the establishment of a new Makhana Board, a greenfield airport, and financial support for key regional projects like the Western Koshi Canal.

Atishi alleged at a press conference on Thursday there is a &quot;conspiracy to kill&quot; Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Atishi addressed claims made by the ED in court that Kejriwal was deliberately eating sweet food like mangoes to increase his blood sugar levels in order to receive bail.&quot;From the past few days, Kejriwal&#39;s sugar level is over 300 mg/dl, but he has been denied insulin by Tihar jail authorities. There&#39;s a conspiracy to kill Kejriwal by stopping his home cooked food supply,&quot; she alleged.Atishi accused the ED of spreading misinformation about Kejriwal&#39;s diet, contending that the federal agency&#39;s claims before the court regarding his consumption of high-sugar foods like mangoes and sweets were false. She asserted that Kejriwal was instead using artificial sweeteners and following a prescribed diet, including bananas, which are recommended for diabetes patients to maintain stable blood sugar levels.&quot;Any doctor will tell you that diabetes patients are asked to carry bananas or any toffee or chocolate because a drop in sugar-level can be dangerous for life. The ED said he is eating aloo-puri. The ED should be afraid of God for lying so much. He ate puri only on the first day of Navratri. All these lies are being spread by the BJP and ED to stop the supply of home-cooked food to Kejriwal,&quot; Atishi said.Atishi further criticised the ED&#39;s alleged attempts to halt the supply of home-cooked meals to Kejriwal in jail, expressing concerns about the transparency and quality of the food he receives if denied access to his preferred diet. She claimed that denying Kejriwal access to insulin, despite his reported high blood sugar levels, amounted to a conspiracy to endanger his life.Meanwhile, Delhi Minister Gopal Rai condemned the BJP for incarcerating Kejriwal during elections. Rai announced AAP&rsquo;s plans for a widespread &#39;Sankalp Sabha&#39; across 200 locations in Delhi to mobilise support for Kejriwal&#39;s release, urging voters to express their dissatisfaction with the BJP&#39;s actions through the ballot on May 25.&quot;Every person who elected Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister is angry.

This landslide victory also marks the downfall of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which had ruled Delhi for over a decade. But how did BJP manage to turn the tables after trailing by nearly 15 per cent in vote share against AAP in the previous elections? Let&rsquo;s break it down.&nbsp;BJP&rsquo;s breakthrough in jhuggis&nbsp;For over a decade, AAP enjoyed unwavering support from Delhi&rsquo;s poor, particularly in slum clusters, thanks to its free electricity and water schemes. However, this time, BJP made significant inroads by offering a powerful counter-strategy.&nbsp; READ: Delhi Election Winners Full List&nbsp;A relentless campaign, combined with the promise of a pucca house for slum dwellers and the assurance of continuing free utilities, helped BJP cut into AAP&rsquo;s stronghold. The party also successfully split the 20 per cent Dalit vote&mdash;historically aligned with AAP&mdash;by leveraging its growing influence among Dalit voters, a trend that began post-2024 Lok Sabha elections.&nbsp;Counter-polarisation to Muslim vote&nbsp;Delhi&rsquo;s 13 per cent Muslim electorate has traditionally backed AAP, particularly in key constituencies with a high Muslim population. However, this election saw BJP making strong gains in areas like Mustafabad and Karawal Nagar&mdash;both sites of the 2020 riots. Candidates Mohan Singh Bisht and Kapil Mishra scored emphatic wins, reflecting a wave of counter-polarisation that worked in BJP&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp;At the same time, the expected split in the Muslim vote due to Congress did not materialise, and a significant shift of Purvanchali voters towards BJP further dented AAP&rsquo;s numbers.&nbsp;The middle-class revolt against AAP&nbsp;The middle class, making up nearly 40 per cent of Delhi&rsquo;s electorate, has been a decisive factor in past elections, often splitting their votes between BJP and AAP. This time, however, they turned overwhelmingly towards the BJP.&nbsp; READ:&nbsp;Factors that led to AAP losing Delhi&#39;s crown in the 2025 Assembly Elections&nbsp;Why? Frustration over deteriorating city infrastructure, rising air pollution, worsening Yamuna conditions, pothole-ridden roads, poor drinking water quality, and unchecked garbage issues pushed them away from AAP. BJP capitalised on this dissatisfaction by directly engaging with Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), market associations, and traders. Additionally, the 8th Pay Commission announcement and tax relief for those earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh further boosted BJP&rsquo;s appeal among middle-class voters.&nbsp;As a result, BJP swept nearly all constituencies in Outer Delhi and Western Delhi, regions that share borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;The freebies strategy that turned the tide&nbsp;BJP learned from its 2020 mistake when it criticised AAP&rsquo;s welfare schemes as &#39;revadis&#39;, a move that backfired. This time, the party assured voters that all free schemes would continue and went a step further by promising Rs 2,500 per month for women&mdash;trumping Kejriwal&rsquo;s Rs 2,100 pledge.&nbsp;This shift was a masterstroke, helping BJP chip away at AAP&rsquo;s core vote bank in slums and attracting women voters, whose turnout outpaced men in 41 Delhi constituencies.&nbsp;Modi factor: The ultimate decider&nbsp;While AAP had a clear CM face in Arvind Kejriwal, BJP relied solely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s towering influence. Despite lacking a projected CM candidate, BJP&rsquo;s campaign focused on PM Modi&rsquo;s appeal, which outshone Kejriwal&rsquo;s image&mdash;tarnished by corruption scandals and the Sheesh Mahal controversy.&nbsp;PM Modi&rsquo;s direct appeal to Delhi voters for a double-engine government&mdash;one that would align with the Centre to accelerate development&mdash;resonated deeply.

Notable recent examples include Yogi Adityanath and Uddhav Thackeray. Adityanath was an MP from Gorakhpur when he was appointed Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, while Thackeray held no constitutional post when he was sworn in as Maharashtra&rsquo;s CM. In 2019, after the Shiv Sena (undivided) severed ties with the NDA and joined the UPA, it formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance to govern Maharashtra, with Thackeray at the helm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedents of CMs without seatsSimilarly, in Uttarakhand, Pushkar Singh Dhami lost the Khatima constituency in the 2022 Assembly elections but was still appointed Chief Minister.

Later, in 2021, she contested the Nandigram Assembly seat but lost to BJP&rsquo;s Suvendu Adhikari. However, as her party secured a majority, she was sworn in as Chief Minister again. In both instances (in 2011 and 2021), she won an assembly seat within the stipulated six-month period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the BJP yet to announce its choice for Delhi&rsquo;s Chief Minister, all eyes are now on the party&rsquo;s leadership to see who will lead the national capital in this new era.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Delhi Assembly elections", "Delhi Assembly elections result", "Delhi CM without MLA", "how to become CM without MLA seat", "Delhi chief minister eligibility", "Article 164(4) India", "non-MLA CM rule", "Delhi politics CM selection", "BJP CM candidate Delhi", "chief minister without election", "Delhi election rules", "constitutional rules for CM", "CM without assembly seat", "Arvind Kejriwal", "AAP", "Delhi election 2025", "Delhi Assembly election 2025", "Delhi election results 2025"], "date": "2025-02-08T16:15:53+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020800899", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:00"},

The last time the party was in power was from 1993 to 1998. Despite leading the capital&rsquo;s first elected government in 37 years, the BJP&#39;s tenure from 1993 to 1998 was marked by instability, internal conflicts, and economic mismanagement, culminating in a crushing defeat by the Congress in December 1998.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi election exit polls LIVE: BJP predicted to trump AAP; Cong facing another wipeout&nbsp;In 1998, soaring onion prices (Rs 40-50 per kg) became a catalyst for widespread public anger, eventually leading to the end of the BJP&#39;s first - and for nearly three decades, only - term in Delhi. Despite dominating national and state politics in other parts of the country, the BJP had been unable to retain power in Delhi until now. As the party prepares to form the government, here&#39;s a look back at its previous term, which was marked by three chief ministers in five years, rising inflation, and leadership turmoil that led to its collapse.&nbsp;1993-1998: Three chief ministers in five yearsBJP won Delhi&rsquo;s first Assembly elections in 1993, forming the government under Madan Lal Khurana, but within five years, the party cycled through three chief ministers &mdash; each facing controversies and internal battles.&nbsp;1. Madan Lal Khurana (1993-1996) &ndash; Corruption and party infighting&nbsp;Despite being a popular leader, Khurana resigned in 1996 amid corruption allegations. The party refused to reinstate him, leading to internal unrest within BJP ranks.&nbsp;2. Sahib Singh Verma (1996-1998) &ndash; Onion crisis, public backlashVerma took over but struggled with economic instability, particularly the onion price crisis in 1998. With prices skyrocketing to Rs 40-50 per kg, the issue dominated public discourse and turned voters against BJP, as onions are a staple in every kitchen. The crisis crippled BJP&rsquo;s image, making it synonymous with inflation and governance failure.&nbsp;3. Sushma Swaraj (1998) &ndash; BJP&rsquo;s last-ditch gamble fails&nbsp;In a desperate move, BJP replaced Verma with Sushma Swaraj, Delhi&rsquo;s first female chief minister, just before elections were due. However, her 52-day tenure was too short to repair the party&rsquo;s damaged reputation, and Congress swept the 1998 elections under Sheila Dikshit.&nbsp;What was the 1998 onion crisis?In January 1998, unseasonal rains impacted onion production, causing prices to rise from Rs 9-12 per kg the previous month to Rs 20-25 per kg. Exports were subsequently banned. Between March and July, exports resumed, but the rabi crop was affected by a heatwave, causing prices to climb even further, reaching Rs 28 by August.&nbsp;Despite these warnings, the central government, led by the BJP under then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unresponsive. By September, the government took notice as unseasonal rains delayed the kharif harvest, too, prompting plans for imports as prices continued to surge. In October, with onion prices breaching the Rs 50 mark, the central government finally allowed imports under the Open General License (OGL), even as international prices rose in anticipation of increased demand from India.&nbsp;India is the second-largest onion-growing country in the world, with significant global demand for its onion crop. During the 2022-23 period, India exported 2.5 MMT of fresh onions, valued at Rs 4,522.79 crore, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.&nbsp;1998 elections: BJP&rsquo;s collapse - Sheila Dikshit&rsquo;s riseThe 1998 elections saw BJP&rsquo;s seat count plummet, while the Congress, under Sheila Dikshit, swept to power. Dikshit remained chief minister for 15 years (1998-2013), focusing on infrastructure development, water supply, and public transport, which helped Congress retain Delhi for three consecutive terms. Delhi&#39;s much-vaunted metro network took shape and expanded under her watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprising entry of AAP in political theatreIn 2013, a new political player disrupted the Congress-BJP rivalry: Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). After a brief first term, Kejriwal&rsquo;s party returned in 2015 with a historic mandate, winning 67 out of 70 seats, reducing BJP to just three seats and wiping out Congress entirely.

It is likely that AAP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Delhi model&rsquo; of development, despite its fiscal pitfalls, replicated by several state governments either fully or partially, would live on.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s look at what led to AAP&rsquo;s defeat in Delhi and why this jolt could lead to the unravelling of the AAP experiment.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi Assembly results 2025: Who are the big losers, and giant slayers&nbsp;The Arvind Kejriwal-led party emerged from the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement of 2011-12. It portrayed itself as a post-ideology party committed to solving difficulties that citizens face with the delivery of government services, and ensuring quality affordable education and healthcare.&nbsp;In Delhi, it spoke for the interests of the poor and the lower middle class with its welfare schemes and keeping water and power supply tariffs low. It also appealed to the sensibilities of Delhi&#39;s cosmopolitan middle class that is usually cynical of most political parties and politicians. Kejriwal became the new age, seemingly incorruptible, meritocratic politician. That he had quit his job as an officer in the elite Indian Revenue Service embellished his appeal as someone who would clean up politics.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi Assembly election results 2025: Check full list of winners here&nbsp;The party secured a famous win in Delhi in 2015, winning 67 of 70 seats with a massive vote share of 54.34 per cent. No party has, or had, ever achieved that feat.&nbsp;In the run up to the Assembly polls in Delhi that year, Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had secured India&rsquo;s first single party majority since 1984 in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Subsequently, the BJP won the Assembly polls in Jharkhand and Haryana. It formed governments with the help of allies in Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir.&nbsp; It was a spectacular phase for the BJP. The Delhi Assembly poll loss was the first shock that the BJP suffered in that phase after a string of successes.&nbsp;&nbsp;AAP and its rising trajectory&nbsp;AAP built on its Delhi success by emerging the principal Opposition party in the Punjab Assembly in 2017.&nbsp;From 2015 to 2020 Delhi Assembly polls, AAP ran with the hare and hunted with hounds. In 2018, AAP launched its campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Ayodhya. It vied for the leadership of the Opposition block, aligning forces with the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress.&nbsp;AAP performed poorly in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but soon started preparing for the Delhi Assembly polls. In 2019 August, AAP supported the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government when Parliament repealed Article 370 of the Constitution that granted Jammu and Kashmir special status. It also welcomed the Supreme Court judgement on the Ram temple.&nbsp;In Delhi, AAP continued to reach out to all sections. For the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls, it responded to BJP&rsquo;s call of &lsquo;Jai Shri Ram&rsquo; with &lsquo;Jai Bajrang Bali&rsquo;. It all seemed to work for the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite losing all the seven seats in Delhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, AAP again shocked the BJP in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls, winning&nbsp; 62 seats with a 53.57 per cent vote share. The BJP&rsquo;s vote share improved from 32.19 per cent (2015) to 38.51 per cent (2020), but was nowhere close to that of AAP. The Congress plummeted further, dropping from 9.65 per cent to 4.26 per cent.&nbsp;However, the AAP experiment worked until it was confronted with difficult ideological choices, which were round the corner. Days after the 2020 Assembly polls, communal riots broke out in Northeast Delhi. AAP leadership, including its legislators, were conspicuous by their absence either in attempting to douse the fire or providing succour to the victims. It left communities disillusioned with AAP.&nbsp;The alarm bells rang for AAP in the December 2022 civic polls in Delhi. The AAP leadership was busy in putting up a fight in Gujarat, where it made the contest a triangular one, further weakening the already feeble challenge that the Congress posed in that state to the ruling BJP.&nbsp;In the Delhi civic polls, AAP emerged the single largest party, but its vote share was 42.05 per cent to the BJP&rsquo;s 39.00 per cent. It was the first sign that the BJP had started bridging the gap between itself and AAP. Equally crucial from AAP&#39;s standpoint was the Congress&#39; improved vote share to 11.68 per cent. The Congress either won seats or did well in areas with significant presence of minorities.&nbsp;AAP- the downfall&nbsp;AAP&rsquo;s sheen as a party led by seemingly incorruptible leaders also wore off as the top leadership was jailed on allegations of corruption and irregularities in the alleged Delhi excise scam. The controversy over &quot;sheesh mahal&quot;, the spanking new chief ministerial bungalow, eroded Kejriwal&#39;s image of a common man. The campaign by the BJP and also Congress that the AAP government did little in terms of capital expenditure, in improving Delhi&#39;s infrastructure in the last decade, struck a chord with the electors, especially the middle class sections.&nbsp;The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&rsquo;s work in Dalit localities, the BJP&rsquo;s outreach to the middle class, including the Union Budget&rsquo;s announcement of tax exemptions, and the government approving setting up the Pay Commission, all contributed to the BJP&rsquo;s win.&nbsp;&nbsp;AAP now faces the prospect that its leader Kejriwal couldn&rsquo;t win his seat. He also faces court cases, as do other top leaders. The only other government that AAP runs is in Punjab, where already a vacuum exists of a traditional panthic party with the decline of, and infighting within, the Shiromani Akali Dal.&nbsp;AAP neither has the leadership nor workers in most of the states due for elections in the next couple of years, such as Bihar later this year and West Bengal, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Kerala in May 2026. It would need to prepare to protect its turf in Punjab, which is scheduled for polls in March 2027, and the Delhi civic polls in December. The question is whether Kejriwal and his associates will be able to keep AAP united and battle-ready until that time.", "keywords": ["Delhi Assembly elections", "Arvind Kejriwal", "Delhi elections", "AAP", "BJP", "Delhi voters", "Narendra Modi", "Delhi Elections result"], "date": "2025-02-08T18:00:31+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020801230", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:02"},

And when he used the descriptive to actually name his party after the aam aadmi, people were drawn to it in droves.That was 2013. Twelve years later, that dream of being a pan-India party and a national level leader is beginning to come undone for the bureaucrat-activist who chose to become a politician - not by joining an established party but starting his own from ground up.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi Assembly elections: How AAP&#39;s sheen wore off and what lies aheadThe Aam Aadmi Party, which ruled Delhi for 10 successive years and also formed government in Punjab, on Saturday lost the election in India&#39;s capital city with 22 seats against the BJP&#39;s 48.Not just that, Kejriwal lost his own seat New Delhi to the BJP&#39;s Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma. It was an ignominious end to the Kejriwal era in Delhi, putting a question mark on the future of the party. And on that of its national convenor.With only Punjab in his pocket, the 56-year-old&#39;s national hopes for himself and his party have been arrested - at least for the moment.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Crushing regional players: After Delhi, is it Bengal, Kerala & TN for BJP?Notwithstanding the loss in Delhi, where many of his senior leaders, including his deputy Manish Sisodia also bit the dust, the AAP is still a player. It has 13 MPs from Punjab and Delhi -- 10 Rajya Sabha MPs, seven from Punjab and three from Delhi, and three Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab.The IIT-Kharagpur graduate and Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer from Haryana first entered electoral politics in 2013, storming the Congress bastion by defeating three-time chief minister Sheila Dikshit. Holding out the promise of freshness in his politics, that was when he became chief minister for the first time by wresting the national capital from established political parties.On February 14, 2014, just 49 days after he became Delhi chief minister for the first time, he quit in a blaze of headlines after alliance partner Congress opposed his pet project, the Jan Lokpal Bill. In the elections that followed in 2015, the AAP won 67 of 70 seats. Five years later, it bagged 62.In 2024, he resigned for the second time when he was jailed over allegations of corruption in the excise scam and said the people of Delhi will give him a certificate of honesty in the assembly polls.That has not happened.Relentless attacks from the BJP over allegations of the aam aadmi&#39; chief minister spending crores on redoing the official residence, the liquor scam, the continuing woes of Delhiites dealing with poor civic facilities in a hopelessly polluted city did their damage.Against this onslaught, the fact that Kejriwal was incarcerated in the excise policy case as was his deputy Sisodia (and fellow minister Satyendar Jain in a money laundering case) did not find the emotional resonance the party was hoping for.And so the gains from the promise of mohalla clinics, model government schools, water and electricity just frittered away.After quitting his career as an income tax officer job in 2000, Kejriwal worked as an RTI activist and lived in slums of Delhi, apparently to understand the problems faced by people living there till 2010. In 2011, he joined Anna Hazare&#39;s anti-corruption movement.Among the first public memories that stay are of Kejriwal on an indefinite hunger strike as part of the &#39;India Against Corruption&#39; movement along with Hazare. Then of him sleeping in his blue Wagon R in bone chilling Delhi winter nights as the newbie chief minister protested over the Jan Lokpal bill.Those images quickly segued into Kejriwal, the leader of national level promise who emerged along with Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, as the one who successfully thwarted the BJP&#39;s plans of unseating the ruling AAP in Delhi with the full force of Modi factor and resources.None of it sat pretty with the BJP&#39;s sheesh mahal&#39; jibe over the luxe CM&#39;s residence.The three-time chief minister&#39;s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in the excise policy linked money laundering case in March 2024 was a setback for the party&#39;s leadership.He stepped down and made senior leader Atishi the chief minister instead. She even kept a pair of khadaus&#39; in a chair, reminiscent of the Maharbharat, to indicate that the chief minister&#39;s chair would wait for him.The party seemed to bounce back with Kejriwal coming out of jail in September last year and firmly holding the reins of the AAP ahead of the polls.The idea was that the AAP would come to power in the elections. But it came to nought.The ambitious plans for Delhi&#39;s development seemed increasingly unachievable, and the promises of a corruption-free administration began to falter under the weight of political pressures.Pugnacious as always, Kejriwal and his party put up a spirited fight against the BJP&#39;s sheesh mahal&#39; charges and that he ran a party that was an &quot;AAPda&quot; (disaster) for the city.Kejriwal&#39;s poison in Yamuna tack did not work. Nor did his argument that the AAP could not do any work because it was stopped from doing so by the LG.Even the promise of freebies, including Rs 2,100 a month for women and increased pension, if the AAP returns to power did not impress.And so Kejriwal withdraws from the capital&#39;s centrestage right now. Perhaps to spend more time with his family - daughter, son, wife and elderly parents who were seen on polling day in wheelchairs. And no doubt to strategise on the future of the party and draw a national level roadmap.", "keywords": ["Arvind Kejriwal", "Delhi Assembly elections", "Delhi elections", "AAP", "India Against Corruption"], "date": "2025-02-08T19:18:28+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020801293", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:04"},

As result day approaches, several key constituencies and candidates are drawing attention, making this one of the most closely watched elections in recent years.&nbsp;Key constituencies to watch&nbsp;New Delhi&nbsp;Arvind Kejriwal continues his tradition of contesting from the New Delhi seat, maintaining a streak that spans the last three Assembly elections. He faces BJP&rsquo;s Parvesh Verma and Congress&rsquo; Sandeep Dikshit. Kejriwal, who won by 21,687 votes in 2020, is banking on AAP&rsquo;s welfare schemes, including a Rs 2,100 monthly allowance for women, as a key election plank.&nbsp;Malviya Nagar&nbsp;AAP&rsquo;s Somnath Bharti is contesting from Malviya Nagar once again, having won the last three elections with significant margins. Bharti, who secured over 50 per cent of the vote share in 2015 and 2020, faces BJP&rsquo;s Satish Upadhyay and Congress&rsquo; Jitendra Kumar Kochar.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi Assembly election results 2025: Date, time, when and where to watch&nbsp;Rohini&nbsp;Rohini constituency is set for a fierce contest between AAP and BJP.

In 2020, Gupta defeated AAP&rsquo;s Rajesh Nama &lsquo;Bansiwala&rsquo; by over 12,000 votes.&nbsp;Ballimaran&nbsp;A traditional stronghold for Muslim candidates, Ballimaran is a key seat in the Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha constituency. AAP has once again nominated Imran Hussain, while Congress has fielded veteran leader Haroon Yusuf. BJP has replaced its 2020 candidate with Kamal Bagri, who won a Delhi Municipal Corporation seat in 2022.&nbsp;Shakur Basti&nbsp;BJP has fielded Karnail Singh, chief of its Delhi Mandir Prakoshth (temple cell), against senior AAP leader Satyendar Jain, making Shakur Basti&nbsp;constituency a high-profile contest.&nbsp;Patparganj&nbsp;A stronghold for the AAP, Patparganj was represented by Manish Sisodia for three consecutive terms. This year, AAP has nominated Awadh Ojha, who will face BJP&rsquo;s Ravinder Singh Negi and Congress&rsquo; Anil Chaudhary. Before AAP&rsquo;s dominance, Congress controlled the seat from 1998 to 2013. In 2020, Sisodia won with 70,163 votes.&nbsp;Kalkaji&nbsp;Kalkaji is witnessing a three-way battle between AAP, Congress, and BJP. AAP has fielded Delhi Chief Minister Atishi Singh against Congress&rsquo; Alka Lamba and BJP&rsquo;s Ramesh Bidhuri. The Kalkaji constituency has 1,94,515 voters. In 2020, Atishi defeated BJP&rsquo;s Dharambir Singh by 11,393 votes.&nbsp;Jangpura&nbsp;AAP won Jangpura in 2015 and 2020 with Praveen Kumar. This year, the party has replaced him with Manish Sisodia, who will face Congress&rsquo; Tarvinder Singh Marwah and Farhad Suri. In 2020, AAP won by over 15,000 votes. Sisodia&rsquo;s nomination is seen as part of AAP&rsquo;s broader strategy to counter anti-incumbency.&nbsp;Okhla&nbsp;AAP&rsquo;s Amanatullah Khan is contesting from Okhla for the third time. Congress has fielded Ariba Khan against him. In both 2015 and 2020, Khan won by margins exceeding 60,000 votes against BJP&rsquo;s Braham Singh.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Delhi Assembly Election 2025", "AAP vs BJP vs Congress", "Arvind Kejriwal New Delhi", "Malviya Nagar election", "Rohini assembly seat", "Ballimaran election candidates", "Shakur Basti BJP vs AAP", "Patparganj election results", "Kalkaji assembly elections", "Jangpura MLA race", "Okhla assembly seat", "Delhi elections key constituencies", "Delhi elections result day", "AAP third term bid", "BJP Congress Delhi elections", "high-stakes Delhi elections", "Delhi election battlegrounds", "AAP manifesto 2025", "BJP campaign Delhi", "Congress Delhi elections 2025", "Delhi voter turnout 2025", "Delhi election predictions", "top Delhi constituencies", "election analysis Delhi", "key candidates Delhi elections"], "date": "2025-02-08T07:45:16+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020701257", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:05"},

The incident unfolded just a day before the Delhi election results, following Lt Governor VK Saxena&rsquo;s directive for the ACB to investigate AAP&rsquo;s &quot;Operation Lotus&quot; accusations against the BJP.&nbsp;AAP MP Sanjay Singh on Thursday alleged that the BJP had offered Rs 15 crore each to seven of the party&rsquo;s candidates to defect. While refraining from naming them, Singh claimed that these candidates received calls from BJP leaders a day after polls.&nbsp;Kejriwal further escalated the charges, tweeting that the BJP had reached out to 16 candidates, offering not just money but also ministerial positions in return for switching loyalties.&nbsp;The Lt Governor&rsquo;s decision follows a formal complaint by Delhi BJP Secretary Vishnu Mittal, who accused AAP of making baseless allegations without evidence.&nbsp;&#39;False and misleading&rsquo; claims, says BJP&nbsp;Mittal, in his letter to Saxena, asserted, &quot;The allegations levelled by Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh are very serious in nature and call for serious and immediate investigation.&quot; He further stated that the claims were an attempt to stir unrest in the capital.&nbsp;&quot;The elections concluded two days ago and by spreading such false and misleading information, he is trying to create panic and a situation of unrest in Delhi,&quot; Mittal wrote, requesting a detailed probe and summoning of AAP leaders.&nbsp;In response, Ashish Kundra, Principal Secretary to the Lt Governor, confirmed that Saxena had ordered the ACB to look into the allegations. The order, based on the BJP&rsquo;s complaint, noted that &quot;allegations are false and baseless and made with an intent to tarnish the image of BJP and create panic and the situation of unrest in Delhi immediately after the conclusion of polling.&quot;&nbsp;AAP challenges BJP to face investigation&nbsp;Reacting to the probe, AAP MP Sanjay Singh dismissed the BJP&rsquo;s stance, saying, &quot;The BJP only wants to do drama, while we want an action into the allegations.&quot; He announced that he would visit the ACB office with his lawyer to lodge a formal complaint.&nbsp;When questioned about the BJP&rsquo;s claim that AAP lacked evidence, Singh retorted, &quot;I spoke about it in front of the media yesterday. What evidence are they asking for? I mentioned a phone number which made the offer to the AAP candidates. What other evidence do you want?&quot;&nbsp;ACB initiates investigation&nbsp;According to reports, the ACB has constituted three teams to probe the matter.

The average of five exit polls predicted a tally of 39 seats for the BJP, securing a majority above the halfway mark of 36, while AAP was projected to win 30 seats.&nbsp;AAP leader Reena Gupta, however, dismissed the projections, citing past instances where exit polls had miscalculated the party&rsquo;s performance in 2013, 2015, and 2020.&nbsp;The Delhi Assembly elections saw a voter turnout of 60.55 per cent in a heated three-way contest between AAP, BJP, and Congress.

The party secured a significant victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, winning 48 out of 70 seats. The current assembly&#39;s tenure ends on February 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swearing-in ceremony for the new chief minister is scheduled for February 20 at 4:30 pm at Ramlila Maidan. BJP&#39;s triumph saw it oust the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which managed to secure only 22 seats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aam Aadmi Party has criticised the BJP for taking &quot;10 days to decide on a chief minister and cabinet&quot;. Former Delhi Chief Minister Atishi said, &quot;It is now evident that the BJP lacks a clear CM candidate. It is also clear that Prime Minister Modi does not have confidence in the 48 elected MLAs.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential candidates for Delhi CM&nbsp;Since the election results were declared on February 8, several names have emerged as potential candidates for the chief ministerial post. Prominent contenders include -- Parvesh Verma (New Delhi), Vijender Gupta (Rohini), Rekha Gupta (Shalimar Bagh), Ashish Sood (Janakpuri), Shikha Roy (Greater Kailash), Bansuri Swaraj (New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency), Manoj Tiwari (North East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency), Chandan Choudhary (Sangam Vihar), and Pankaj Kumar Singh (Vikaspuri).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parvesh Verma&#39;s strong electoral performance is seen as his key advantage. Historically, winners from the New Delhi constituency have often been elevated to the chief minister&rsquo;s post, as seen with Congress&#39; Sheila Dikshit and AAP&rsquo;s Arvind Kejriwal. Additionally, Verma has been associated with the BJP for nearly three decades and is the son of former Delhi Chief Minister and BJP senior vice-president Sahib Singh Verma.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also speculation that the party might opt for a woman candidate, given that female voters played a crucial role in BJP&rsquo;s victory. Rekha Gupta, Shikha Roy, and Bansuri Swaraj are being considered as strong contenders in this scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possibility is the selection of a leader from the Purvanchali community, given the significant role Purvanchal voters played in BJP&rsquo;s win. Names such as Manoj Tiwari, Chandan Choudhary, and Pankaj Kumar Singh are being discussed, especially since Bihar is gearing up for elections, making a Purvanchali CM a strategic choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BJP&rsquo;s landslide victory&nbsp;To recall, the BJP secured a commanding majority by winning 48 out of 70 seats in the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections. The contest was largely between the BJP and AAP, which had governed Delhi for two consecutive terms but managed to secure only 22 seats in this election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BJP&rsquo;s CM selection process&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, the BJP appoints observers from its central leadership ahead of the legislature party meeting. These observers interact with the newly elected MLAs and provide feedback to the party&rsquo;s high command, which then finalises the chief ministerial candidate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to PTI, many leaders within the party believe the BJP may choose a newly elected MLA for the role, following the precedent set in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Odisha. Reports from ANI suggest that Parvesh Verma, along with former Delhi BJP presidents Vijender Gupta and Satish Upadhyay, are leading contenders for the post.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swearing-in ceremony is expected to be attended by chief ministers and deputy chief ministers from 20 states, alongside diplomats from various countries. According to an NDTV report, around 50 film stars and industrialists will also be present.

If it was only meant for the general elections, then it should be dissolved,&rdquo; Abdullah stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Congress&rsquo; loss in Haryana, discontent among its allies grew, particularly after the party&rsquo;s alliance with Sharad Pawar&rsquo;s NCP and Uddhav Thackeray&rsquo;s Shiv Sena suffered a heavy defeat in Maharashtra in November. This further deepened cracks within the Opposition bloc. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also expressed interest in leading the alliance, garnering support from some allies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also read:&nbsp;Winner list of delhi Election 2025&nbsp;Abdullah also cautioned Congress against assuming leadership of the Opposition by default. &ldquo;Being the largest opposition party in Parliament, holding the leader of opposition positions in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and having a nationwide presence makes Congress a natural leader of the opposition. However, some allies feel the party is not doing enough to justify this role.

Key facts you need to know for Delhi elections 2025", "content": "As Delhi gears up for the 2025 Assembly elections on February 5, the political battleground of the national capital is heating up. The sudden resignation of AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, followed by his release from jail on corruption charges, has injected fresh drama into the race. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress are intensifying their campaigns, deploying popular leaders in rallies to sway Delhi&rsquo;s electorate.&nbsp;Key voting details you need to know&nbsp;The Election Commission of India has announced that voting will take place in a single phase across all 70 constituencies of Delhi.&nbsp; Polling stations will open at 7.00 am and close at 6.30 pm on February 5 (Wednesday), giving voters enough time to cast their votes. To encourage maximum participation, government offices and schools will remain closed, and many private offices may offer flexible hours for employees to vote.&nbsp;When will the results be announced?&nbsp;The counting of votes will begin on February 8, 2025, with results expected on the same day. Exit polls, which give an early glimpse into voter preferences, will be released after 6.30 pm on February 5, following the Election Commission&rsquo;s guidelines.&nbsp;What are exit polls and why do they matter?&nbsp;Exit polls are surveys conducted with voters immediately after they leave polling stations. These polls aim to predict the likely outcome based on voter responses. While exit polls can offer insights into voting trends, they aren&rsquo;t always accurate.&nbsp;The reliability of exit polls depends on several factors such as the sampling method, margin of error, and more importantly, the honesty of respondents. Despite these limitations, exit polls generate significant buzz and set the tone for post-election discussions.&nbsp;Exit poll rules: What you should know&nbsp;According to the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Section 126A), exit polls cannot be conducted or publicised until voting concludes. This regulation ensures that exit polls do not influence voter decisions during the polling process.&nbsp;Exit poll blunders: When predictions missed the mark&nbsp;While exit polls often grab headlines, they have a mixed track record. Here are notable examples where they got it wrong:&nbsp;- Lok Sabha elections 2024: Exit polls predicted a massive win for the NDA, with estimates ranging from 353 to 401 seats. However, the BJP secured only 240 seats, and the NDA won 293, falling short of expectations. The Congress-led INDIA bloc exceeded predictions with 235 seats.&nbsp;- Chhattisgarh Assembly elections 2023: Pollsters forecasted a close contest with a slight edge for Congress. In reality, the BJP won decisively with 54 seats, toppling the Congress government.&nbsp;- UP Assembly elections 2017: Post-demonetisation, exit polls predicted a hung assembly. Contrary to this, the BJP secured a landslide victory with 325 out of 403 seats, propelling Yogi Adityanath to the Chief Minister&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;- West Bengal Assembly elections 2021: Exit polls anticipated a BJP majority. Instead, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) won a commanding mandate with 213 seats, while BJP managed just 77.&nbsp;- Bihar Assembly elections 2020: Many polls favoured the RJD-led alliance. However, the BJP-JD(U) coalition emerged victorious, with the RJD becoming the single-largest party but unable to form the government.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["What are exit polls", "delhi polls", "delhi elections 2025", "delhi assembly elections", "delhi election results", "delhi exit polls", "delhi voting schedule", "delhi election updates", "delhi polling dates", "delhi voter turnout", "delhi election news", "delhi election analysis", "delhi election candidates", "delhi election phase", "delhi political parties", "delhi election predictions", "delhi exit poll results", "delhi vote counting", "delhi election timeline", "delhi election guide", "delhi election process", "delhi election key dates", "delhi election exit poll trends", "delhi election turnout statistics", "delhi election voting details", "delhi 2025 election results", "delhi assembly poll updates", "delhi election outcome", "delhi election coverage", "exit polls meaning"], "date": "2025-02-03T17:18:49+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020300928", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:08"},

To facilitate a smooth voting process, 733 polling stations have been designated for persons with disabilities.The Election Commission has also introduced a Queue Management System (QMS) application for the first time in India, allowing voters to check real-time crowd levels at polling stations through the Delhi Election - 2025 QMS app.Under the home voting facility for senior citizens and persons with disabilities, 6,980 out of 7,553 eligible voters have already cast their votes. This service, which began on January 24, will continue until February 4.To ensure free and fair elections, 220 companies of paramilitary forces, 19,000 home guards, and 35,626 Delhi Police personnel will be deployed.Additionally, 21,584 ballot units, 20,692 control units, and 18,943 VVPATs have been prepared, including provisions for dummy and Braille ballot papers.In 2015, AAP swept 67 of the 70 seats at stake, leaving just three for the BJP and none for the Congress.In 2020, AAP maintained its dominance with 62 seats, while the BJP won eight and the Congress once again failed to open its account.With a resurgent BJP confident of breaking AAP&#39;s streak and the Congress eyeing a revival, Delhi is set for one of its most intense electoral battles yet.The final verdict will reveal whether the rhetoric and slogans resonated with the voters or if the capital&#39;s political landscape remains unchanged.Whether the AAP retains its hold on Delhi, the BJP stages a comeback, or the Congress springs a surprises -- the picture will be clear once the results are out on February 8.", "keywords": ["Delhi Assembly elections", "Arvind Kejriwal", "BJP", "Congress", "Aam Aadmi Party"], "date": "2025-02-03T09:17:59+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020300134", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:12"},

And we kept an eye on it daily. There was no power cut anywhere for ten years.

In the last year alone, there were 21,597 power cuts lasting over an hour. On average, that&#39;s 59 outages per day,&quot; said Sood, sharing statistics from the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC).He further stated that 3,278 instances of power cuts were recorded in January 2025 alone.Challenging Kejriwal&#39;s assertion that there were no power cuts during his tenure, Sood posted on X, &quot;You are tweeting from Punjab while making claims about Delhi&#39;s power supply.&quot;&nbsp;Addressing a press conference, the BJP leader also shared detailed data on power cuts over the past year.There were 2,660 instances in January 2024, 2,881 in February, 2,745 in March, 1,567 in April, 676 in May, 605 in June, 602 in July, 690 in August, 1,531 in September, 1,852 in October, 1,000 in November, 1,510 in December and 3,278 in January 2025, he said.Sood asserted that these figures contradict Kejriwal&#39;s claims of uninterrupted power supply during his government&#39;s tenure.The minister said that the government had prioritized assessing Delhi&#39;s electricity preparedness since taking charge.He said the city&#39;s peak power demand this summer is expected to reach 9,000 MW, necessitating a thorough review of existing agreements with the power distribution companies (DISCOMs).&quot;As part of our commitment to ensuring an uninterrupted power supply, we have asked the DERC (Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission) to scrutinize all power purchase agreements. This will help optimize procurement and address any inefficiencies,&quot; he said.Sood also highlighted the establishment of a joint control room in coordination with Delhi Transco Limited (DTL) and DISCOMs to monitor power loads in real time.This initiative, he explained, will allow the authorities to detect overburdened feeders, prevent infrastructure damage and redistribute loads efficiently.The minister assured the government is working proactively to ensure a stable electricity supply in the coming months.He also revealed that permission has been sought from the Centre to procure electricity from the unshared power schedule if necessary.Reiterating the government&#39;s focus remains on strengthening Delhi&#39;s electricity infrastructure, Sood said, &quot;We are taking data-driven decisions, not indulging in politics.

His closest competitor, Naresh Gaur of the BJP got 51,714 votes, while Anviksha Jain of the Congress could manage just 5,131 votes.Talking about his own constituency, Rai said, &quot;I have worked harder than ever.

I got a chance to serve Haryana from 2005-2014,&quot; he told the people.The former chief minister said that when the Congress was in power in Haryana, it was &quot;number one&quot; in per capita income, per capita investment, providing jobs, law and order situation and sports activities in the country.&quot;After 10 years, Haryana today is number one in unemployment and inflation while crime has also increased,&quot; he alleged.Hooda said the Congress will come out with an election manifesto soon that will include raising old-age pension to Rs 6,000, providing LPG cylinders at Rs 500 and 300 units of free electricity.&quot;I want to fight a battle not for myself but for you and want to make the state number one once again,&quot; the senior Congress leader told the gathering.He said the electoral contest in Haryana is between the Congress and the BJP, and asked people to be cautious of &quot;vote katau&quot; (vote cutters).&quot;Five years ago, a &#39;vote cutter&#39; took 10 seats. This time, not even a single vote is to be wasted,&quot; Hooda said. In the 2019 Assembly elections, the Jannayak Janta Party got 10 seats and went to ally with the BJP and form government.&quot;Again the same conspiracy is being hatched. Earlier, there was one and now there is another one which is the BJP&#39;s B-team. So beware of these vote cutters,&quot; the former chief minister said.The Aam Aadmi Party, which was in talks with the Congress for a pre-poll alliance in Haryana, has so far fielded 41 candidates for the 90-member assembly.Hooda termed the elections a &quot;do or die battle&quot; and said, &quot;Not just Garhi Sampla Kiloi, you have to take the fight everywhere.&quot;Meanwhile, AAP leader Manish Sisodia praised party nominee Anurag Dhanda who has been fielded from the Kalayat seat. Lashing out at the ruling party in Haryana, he alleged, &quot;The BJP has completely lost the trust of people.&quot;&quot;They shut thousands of schools in the state.

After the Hooda camp got an upper hand over Selja when the Congress selected election candidates, the BJP accused its rival of discriminating against Dalits. Meanwhile, Congress responded politically to this strategy by getting BJP leader Ashok Tanwar to return to the Grand Old Party after 5 years on Thursday, which was incidentally the last day of campaigning for the Haryana elections. Tanwar, who is a Dalit, is a former Lok Sabha MP and ex-state president of Congress.&nbsp;According to such observers the BJP and the Congress realise the importance of Dalits, who comprise around 21 per cent of the state&#39;s population and are crucial for any party wanting to win elections in Haryana.#WATCH | Haryana BJP leader Ashok Tanwar joined Congress in the presence of Congress MP and Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi and former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, in Mahendragarh(Source: Congress) pic.twitter.com/g4pqSmbqGo&mdash; ANI (@ANI) October 3, 2024Since 2014, the BJP in Haryana has wooed every community except Jats. It won the 2014 and 2019 assembly elections after creating a Jat vs non-Jat binary. Several Dalits helped the party to strengthen its non-Jat coalition, which already had the support of a good chunk of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Punjabi Khatris, and upper castes.The question is whether Dalits vote alike in elections. Some analysts believe Dalits will support the Congress but others think that a significant proportion of the community can be considered as a core voter base of BJP.To some extent, how Haryana&#39;s Dalits vote can be understood by examining sub-castes in the community.Dalits in HaryanaThe Jatavs (officially known as Chamars in Haryana)&nbsp;are the most populous sub-caste within the Dalits in Haryana and comprise almost 50 per cent of the total scheduled caste (SC) population. &quot;The community largely resides in the state&#39;s rural belt and unlike other sub-caste groups has decent landholdings as well. Currently, many community members, especially those residing in villages, work as labourers in agricultural fields,&quot; said Prakash Chander, a PhD scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi and who has worked for the rights of Dalits.Jatavs are considered a Congress core vote bank and they align well with Jats (another support base of the party), according to Chander. Over the years, the two communities have voted for the Congress. Selja, a Lok Sabha member, is regarded as the tallest Jatav politician in Haryana.Haryana&#39;s second most dominant Dalit sub-caste is the Valmiki community, which comprises around 25-30 per cent of the state&#39;s SC population.Valmikis live in urban and rural areas and many work as sanitation workers or in related jobs. According to analysts, the community largely votes for the BJP, which has given four tickets to the community. The Congress has given two. &quot;The saffron party (the BJP) made inroads into the community by penetrating municipal corporation-led civic committees. Such civic committees, especially those related to sanitation workers, have a good presence of Valmikis,&quot; said Chander.Third are the Dhanaks, who mostly live in cities and comprise a little more than 10 per cent of the total SC population of Haryana. Community members have worked as labourers in food grain markets. Dhanaks come under the deprived scheduled castes (DSC) category in Haryana. &quot;The community is underprivileged, especially when compared to other SC sub-caste groups like Jatavs,&quot; he said.&quot;With BJP&#39;s better presence than Congress in urban areas, Dhanaks were attracted to the former in the last couple of elections. However, things have started to change, and BJP will find it very difficult to keep Dhanaks in its fold,&quot; said Surendra Bhaderwal, a political consultant.Other Dalit sub-castes like Doms, Pasis, Mazhabi Sikhs, Khatiks, Bazigars, and Saperas are too few to influence electoral politics.Caste equationsThe Congress and the BJP have fielded 17 Dalit candidates each but only in SC reserved seats (the state has 90 assembly seats). According to estimates, the BJP has given eight tickets to Jatav candidates, four to Valmikis and five to other Dalit sub-castes. The Congress has given 12 tickets to Jatav candidates, two to Valmikis, and three to others. This reflects which sub-castes both parties are planning to consolidate behind them more.The Congress has had a Dalit-Jat combo strategy in Haryana for almost two decades. It typically appoints a Dalit leader as its state president and makes a Jat face its Congress legislature party (CLP) leader or Chief Minister (CM). Some notable examples are Bhupinder Singh Hooda (CLP leader) and Udai Bhan (state president), Kiran Choudhary (CLP leader) and Ashok Tanwar (state president), and Hooda (CM) and Phool Chand Mullana (state president).The Dalit population in Haryana is not equally distributed. In Fatehabad, Sirsa and Ambala districts, the community comprises more than one-fourth of the population. In Nuh, Faridabad and Gurugram, the community is sparse.The Congress has been able to bring together Jats, Jatavs and Muslims but not the entire Dalit community into its fold. The only time almost all Dalit communities voted for a single party in an assembly election was during Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) founder Devi Lal tenure as Chief Minister. Experts believe that going by the 2024 Lok Sabha polls result, it seems that Dalits are attracted to the Congress but a trend is not certain.&quot;The BJP is trying its best to make big inroads, and Valmikis will most likely vote for the saffron outfit. Also, the alliance between INLD & Bahujan Samaj party (BSP) is likely to garner some Dalit votes, especially for the latter, as BSP has some presence in the state, and along with INLD, it becomes a formidable player on at least a few seats like Yamunanagar and Ellenabad,&quot; said Bhaderwal.&quot;The other Jat-Dalit alliance Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and Azad Samaj Party (ASP) of is unlikely to make much impact as presently, JJP&#39;s credibility is at an all-time low and ASP is a new entrant in Haryana politics. However, both Dalit parties (BSP and ASP) won&#39;t make much impact, but whatever SC votes they will get are likely to come from members belonging to the Jatav sub-caste.&quot;&quot;Supreme Court allowing states to create sub-classifications within the SC and ST categories has also been taken positively by the non-dominant Dalit sub-caste groups as many of them in Haryana feel that the maximum amount of reservation benefits are being availed disproportionately by the Jatavs,&quot; said Chander.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress and the BJP won five seats each in the state. But the Congress won the two SC reserved seats: Ambala and Sirsa. In the 2019 Assembly polls, the BJP won more seats than Congress and formed the government in alliance with JJP. However, the Congress gained against the BJP in SC reserved constituencies, winning seven out of the 17 such seats. The BJP secured five, while JJP and independents won four and one respectively..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}", "keywords": ["Dalits", "Haryana election", "Haryana", "Congress", "BJP", "national politics", "Bhupinder Singh Hooda", "Rahul Gandhi", "Narendra Modi"], "date": "2024-10-05T00:17:54+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124100401173", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:17"},

Senior party leader Abhishek Singhvi joined the meeting online.The Congress leaders alleged that there are at least 20 such complaints, including seven in writing from as many assembly constituencies, with many referring to EVMs functioning at 99 per cent battery capacity whereas the average EVMs were found to be operating at 60 to 70 per cent battery capacity during the counting.Infighting, over reliance on sitting MLAs and rebel trouble appeared to be some of the contributing factors for the Congress failing to make a comeback in Haryana after a decade.The party appeared confident of dislodging the BJP dispensation which was in power for 10 years and facing anti-incumbency.However, the BJP with 48 seats halted the Congress&#39; comeback attempt and also proved several exit polls wrong which had predicted a comfortable win for the grand old party in Haryana.

Speaking to The Indian Express, she questioned why she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to participate more actively and accused the state unit of monopolising key decisions such as ticket distribution. &ldquo;We kept warning that workers were being ignored, but nothing changed,&rdquo; she alleged.The former Union minister and MP for Sirsa expressed hope that the party leadership would thoroughly examine the causes of the defeat, emphasising the importance of unity and coordination among state leaders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident the Congress will review all aspects that led to this outcome,&rdquo; Selja said.Selja calls for introspection amid BJP&rsquo;s successDespite facing anti-incumbency and a drop in seats during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is now set to form the Haryana government for a third consecutive term. However, in the Congress camp, tensions surfaced even before the final results were declared. Kumari Selja, who had expressed dissatisfaction during the campaign led by former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, said that &ldquo;it will not be business as usual&rdquo; and urged the party leadership to reflect on the outcome.Selja expressed disappointment, particularly for the Congress workers who had hoped to end the BJP&rsquo;s 10-year rule. &ldquo;The results are painful, especially for our workers who toiled hard with the expectation of forming a government. The high command must identify those who undermined these efforts,&rdquo; she said.Selja also criticised the party&rsquo;s state unit for failing to build on the momentum generated by Rahul Gandhi&rsquo;s efforts. &quot;It&rsquo;s shocking how badly we performed,&rdquo; she said..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}", "keywords": ["Congress", "Haryana election", "Kumari Selja", "Congress internal disputes", "BJP victory Haryana", "Haryana Assembly election results", "Congress defeat Haryana", "Bhupinder Singh Hooda", "Congress factionalism", "Rahul Gandhi Haryana campaign", "Congress introspection", "Haryana Congress leadership", "Haryana political news", "Indian politics", "Haryana government formation"], "date": "2024-10-09T16:01:00+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124100900679", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:18"},

Now, we are permanent residents of Tripura following the 2020 historic accord. It hardly matters to us who comes to power in that state,&quot; Charles, secretary of Kaskoupata Bru resettlement village in North Tripura district, told PTI.During the 2018 Mizoram assembly elections, a large number of Bru voters who were then staying in relief camps in Tripura came to their home state and voted at 15 special polling booths created for them in Kanhmun village along the inter-state border after public outrage over their place of voting.Charles said Brus had tried to live in Mizoram peacefully, but could not because of skirmishes with the majority Mizo community.&quot;We are happy that the refugee status no longer haunts us. Now, the Brus are permanent residents of Tripura. We are not concerned about Mizoram at all, but are focused on the future of thousands of Bru brothers and sisters,&quot; he said.Bru migrant voters had been able to exercise their franchise for the first time in many years during the Tripura assembly elections in February. Special efforts were made to enrol voters from the community.Nishikanta Reang, one of the members of the Bru tribal community also known as Reangs, is also not concerned about Mizoram elections.&quot;I have no time to think about elections in Mizoram. Let them rule Mizoram as per their wish because we could not become part of the state even after being born there,&quot; the father of five lamented.&quot;Sometimes, we remember our land where we were born and raised. But the past is past. We are now focused on the present and future,&quot; Charles said.Most Brus residing in Tripura today have suffered over two decades of internal displacement from Mizoram. It all started in 1995 when certain Mizo organisations demanded that Brus be eliminated from Mizoram&#39;s electoral rolls as they were not indigenous inhabitants.Tensions escalated after the Brus retaliated against the attempts to disenfranchise them, and organised themselves into an armed group, the Bru National Liberation Front, and a political entity, the Bru National Union.They also demanded the creation of a separate Bru Autonomous District Council (ADC) in western Mizoram as per the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Nishikanta is still worried over the fate of 35,000-odd Bru people who have resettled at the new locations.&quot;The Bru accord is a mixed bag for us. We are now permanent residents of Tripura and the Centre has been giving some benefits to restart our lives. But some aspects still need to be sorted out for permanent solution of Bru rehabilitation,&quot; Reang said.&quot;The Centre will give Rs 5,000 per month to each Bru family for two years. But what will happen after that? I am really worried about the future. The state government must provide land for cultivation and animal rearing in the resettled villagers,&quot; he said.According to the agreement, each family is eligible to get a monthly stipend of Rs 5,000 for two years and certain other facilities including a plot of land, Rs 1.5 lakh for constructing a house on it and a one-time allowance of Rs 4 lakh.The pact was signed by representatives of the Brus, the Centre, Tripura and Mizoram governments in New Delhi in January 2020.Under the pact, more than 30,000 displaced Bru tribals from Mizoram, who have been living as refugees in Tripura since 1997, will permanently settle in the northeastern state.Nishikanta appealed to the Tripura government to provide land for animal rearing immediately.&quot;If we buy a piglet at Rs 5,000, it will give returns of Rs 30,000 within a year.

If you think you can come together by insulting each other then that&#39;s not possible, Shirsat said referring to attacks by the Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders.The original Shiv Sena, then under Uddhav Thackeray, split in June 2022 after Shinde led a rebellion, walked away with his supporters and aligned with the BJP to become chief minister of Maharashtra. Subsequently, he got the party name and its bow and arrow&#39; symbol.Since the division, the two Sena factions have relentlessly attacked each other.In the Maharashtra assembly elections held last year, the Sena headed by Shinde, a partner in the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance, won 57 of the state&#39;s 288 seats.By contrast, the Sena (UBT), which has aligned with the Congress and Sharad Pawar&#39;s NCP (SP) under the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), bagged only 20.Altogether, the Mahayuti won 230 seats, while the MVA got just 46.", "keywords": ["Bal Thackeray", "Thackeray family", "Indian Hindus", "Shiv Sena", "Uddhav Thackeray", "Sanjay Shirsat", "Aaditya Thackeray", "Kailas Patil", "spokesperson", "Maharashtra Shiv Sena", "Maharashtra", "Eknath Shinde", "Congress", "chief minister", "Sharad Pawar", "Maha Vikas", "minister", "Marathi channel", "Deputy Chief Minister", "NCP (SP)", "youth leader"], "date": "2025-02-02T10:02:08+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020200079", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:29"},

Those who rise through treachery often fall by it. The attacks on Shinde have begun, and Maharashtra has been left in a state of uncertainty and disorder,&quot; he said.Raut also claimed that Shinde&#39;s control over his political turf Thane was being systematically undermined by the BJP.The appointment of BJP minister Ganesh Naik as the guardian minister of neighbouring Palghar district is reportedly part of this strategy, he charged.&quot;Naik was already a minister in the first Shiv Sena-BJP government when Shinde was just a municipal councillor. He will not take orders from Shinde,&quot; Raut wrote in his column.Notably, Naik last week said he wants the saffron party to flourish in Thane, indicating there could be a tussle between the two allies.Naik had also said he would be holding public grievance meetings in Thane too, triggering speculation that the BJP was preparing to challenge the dominance of Shinde&#39;s party in the area.According to Raut, Shinde&#39;s role in the government has diminished significantly. He is often absent from crucial cabinet meetings, and when he does attend, he is noticeably late.&quot;On January 30, he arrived two-and-a-half-hours late for a District Planning Committee meeting at the World Trade Centre,&quot; he claimed.Raut alleged that Shinde feels betrayed by the BJP leadership.Quoting a senior MLA from the Shiv Sena, Raut claimed Union Home Minister Amit Shah had assured Shinde that the 2024 assembly elections would be fought under his leadership and that he would continue as CM.Encouraged by the promise, Shinde is believed to have spent enormous amounts of money during the campaign. However, when the time came, Shah allegedly did not keep his word, leading Shinde to feel deceived and politically cornered, Raut claimed quoting the legislator.Raut said the MLA also told him that Shinde now suspects his phone calls are being monitored and that central agencies are tracking his movements.&quot;An MLA told me that Shinde is convinced that surveillance is being conducted on him and his associates,&quot; the Sena (UBT) leader claimed.A senior BJP minister recently dismissed the reports of tensions, stating there were no &quot;major differences&quot; between Fadnavis and Shinde.However, Raut countered that argument, pointing out that similar claims were made before the Shiv Sena split (in June 2022). &quot;What happened after that is something the entire country witnessed,&quot; he said.Raut further claimed that many MLAs in Shinde&#39;s faction were now &quot;uneasy&quot;, with some contemplating switching over to the BJP under Fadnavis&#39; leadership, while others wanting a return to the Thackeray-led Sena (UBT). But the fear of central agencies has left them hesitant to act, he added.&quot;Shinde&#39;s leadership is no longer secure,&quot; Raut further claimed, alleging that even the BJP was working against him.The RSS has deployed its own people as personal assistants to ministers from both the Shinde and Ajit Pawar (NCP) camps to monitor their activities and curb corruption, he charged.Unlike Shinde, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar is in a much more stable position, Raut said.&quot;Ajit Pawar understands his limitations and has built a stronger working relationship with Fadnavis,&quot; he said.Pawar joined hands with the BJP to avoid action by the Enforcement Directorate (in some cases), to recover attached assets of Rs 1,000 crore and gain the deputy CM&#39;s post as an additional benefit, Raut claimed.Unlike Shinde, Pawar has no aspirations of becoming chief minister and is content with a &quot;politically safer&quot; position, he added.", "keywords": ["Shiv Sena", "Bharatiya Janata Party", "Eknath Shinde", "Devendra Fadnavis", "Uddhav Thackeray", "Sanjay Rathod", "Maharashtra political crisis", "Maharashtra", "Sanjay Raut", "Rajya Sabha", "leader", "Union Home Minister", "District Planning Committee", "Maharashtra government", "Ganesh Naik", "Palghar", "minister", "senior BJP minister", "guardian minister", "BJP minister", "legislator", "MP", "chief minister", "World Trade Centre", "disorder", "Shinde's party", "Deputy Chief Minister", "Amit Shah", "Ajit Pawar", "municipal councillor", "Maharashtra Chief Minister", "Enforcement Directorate"], "date": "2025-02-02T14:13:38+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020200228", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:29"},

The scheme has, as of now, some 2.5 crore beneficiaries, though the government is now carrying out a scrutiny to omit those who are ineligible.Data indicates that married women constitute 83 per cent while unmarried women constitute 11.8 per cent of the beneficiaries, a senior official said on Thursday. Widows account for 4.7 per cent of beneficiaries, while &#39;divorced, destitute or deserted&#39; women collectively make up less than 1 per cent of the cohort. Divorced women account for 0.3 per cent, deserted women 0.2 per cent, and destitute women for 0.1 per cent of beneficiaries.

While both Shinde and Fadnavis have denied that there is a discord, recent developments suggested there are simmering tensions.After the elections, Shinde had to agree to a role reversal with Fadnavis, his deputy in the previous regime, becoming chief minister.The appointment of NCP leader Aditi Tatkare and BJP leader Girish Mahajan as guardian ministers of Raigad and Nashik districts, respectively, brought tensions to the fore, with the Shiv Sena leaders expressing unhappiness. Both the appointments were revoked and Fadnavis is yet to take a fresh decision.Both deputy CMs, Shinde and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, set up project monitoring cells to track the progress of projects in the districts of which they are guardian ministers, and those of departments handled by ministers of their respective parties. As the CM already has his &quot;war room&quot; for monitoring key projects, this was seen as both the BJP allies asserting themselves.While the Chief Minister&#39;s relief fund -- from which needy patients can receive help -- already existed, Shinde set up his own medical aid cell. Shinde has also stayed away from several meetings convened by Fadnavis, including the Nashik Regional Development Authority meeting to discuss preparations for the 2027 Kumbh Mela in the north Maharashtra city.He held a separate meeting in Nashik where BJP minister Girish Mahajan was absent.After Fadnavis held a review meeting of the Industries department, Shinde held another meeting recently. Industries department is headed by Shiv Sena minister Uday Samant. The buzz about the relations being under growing strain became louder when the Home department, headed by Fadnavis, downgraded or took away the police security of 20 Shiv Sena MLAs. They had been given security cover after the Sena split in 2022.Earlier this week, Shinde had said there was absolutely no &quot;cold war&quot; between him and Fadnavis. Fadnavis too downplayed Shinde&#39;s decision to set up a medial cell. &quot;There is nothing wrong, as its aim is to help people. When I was deputy chief minister, I had formed a similar cell,&quot; the BJP leader said.", "keywords": ["Eknath Shinde", "Fadnavis", "politics"], "date": "2025-02-21T20:23:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022101173", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:31"},

The move signals an escalating rift between the Shinde-led faction and Fadnavis&rsquo; BJP in the state.&nbsp;According to a report by The Indian Express, On February 17, 2025, CM Fadnavis issued an order in which he emphasised some &lsquo;irregularities&rsquo; in the state&rsquo;s Minimum Support Price (MSP) schemes and selection of nodal agencies for crop procurement.&nbsp;Additionally, he formed a comprehensive panel to design the &lsquo;comprehensive policy&rsquo; to study the matter in detail and suggest possible solutions for the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fadnavis highlighted irregularitiesAccording to the report, a six member committee has been formed by the state&rsquo;s Marketing Ministry under the BJP&rsquo;s Jaykumar Rawal. This decision came in response to the alleged irregularities and &lsquo;demand for money&rsquo; by procurement agencies. These agencies were approved by the previous Shide government under the Centre&rsquo;s Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) scheme. At that time, Shiv Sena minister Abdul Sattar was heading the Marketing Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;While purchasing agricultural produce at the guaranteed price under the Minimum Support Scheme, some state-level nodal agencies have been found to be demanding money from various farm producers&rsquo; companies, which come under their jurisdiction, to start procurement centers,&rdquo; the latest order stated, according to the report.&nbsp;Govt flags procurement irregularitiesThe order further mentioned that these agencies, approved by the Shinde government, were &ldquo;asking for money for the procurement process at the centers and illegally taking money&rdquo; from them. The order highlighted another issue, saying that &ldquo;some nodal institutions (responsible for procurement, storage, and distribution of agricultural produce) have more than one family member on their board of directors.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Considering all these factors, the state government found it necessary to adopt a comprehensive criteria/ working method for determining the state-level nodal institutions for implementing the said scheme in the state,&rdquo; the order stated.&nbsp;Who will head the new committee?The new committee will be led by the managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation. It will also include the managing director of NAFED in Mumbai, the state marketing director in Pune, the chief marketing officer of the state agricultural marketing board in Pune, and a former joint director from the Department of Co-Operation, Marketing & Textiles in Maharashtra.&nbsp;According to the order, the committee will study and create a detailed policy on how MSP schemes under PM-AASHA should work and how SLAs should be selected.&nbsp;Widening rift between Shinde and Fadnavis&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, this decision by the Fadnavis administration and reports of Shinde skipping several key meetings of the cabinet, hinting a widening rift among them. For example, earlier, Fadnavis, ordered to remove security covers for several Shiv Sena MLAs who were ministers earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, last week, the CM&rsquo;s office ordered an inquiry into a delayed housing project in Jalna worth Rs 900 crore. It was approved for revival in 2023 by Shinde. In another action, earlier this month, the state also cancelled a BMC contract worth Rs 1,400 crore for waste collection, slum cleaning, and drainage and toilet maintenance. This contract was issued when Shinde was Chief Minister.&nbsp;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take me lightly&rsquo;: Shinde warned&nbsp;However, in response to all these back-to-back actions by the Fadnavis administration, Shiv Sena supremo Shinde issued not a direct but a clear warning in Nagpur. He also warned of the consequences if he was not taken seriously.&nbsp;While speaking to the reporters in Nagpur, Shide said, &ldquo;Do not take me lightly. I have already said this to those who took me lightly in the past. I am an ordinary party worker, but I am a worker of Bala Saheb and Dighe Saheb and so people should keep that in mind.

Those who know both of us will remember what we do when we are together, said Fadnavis, pointing to their meetings before Shinde&#39;s rebellion split the undivided Shiv Sena and sunk the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in 2022.While Fadnavis maintained that all partners of ruling Mahayuti BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP are working unitedly, Shinde chipped in, Everything is thanda thanda, cool cool.Shinde, who heads the Shiv Sena, said the budget session will be the first House proceedings of the new government after Mahayuti&#39;s stunning victory in the state polls last year.It is just that Fadnavis and I have swapped our chairs. Only Ajit Pawar&#39;s chair is fixed, said Shinde, who was the CM before the assembly elections with Fadnavis and Pawar as his deputies then.Pawar came up with the repartee, What can I do if you couldn&#39;t keep your chair, sending all three into peals of laughter.Fadnavis dismissed the reports that claimed that he had stayed decisions taken by his predecessor. I have not stayed any decision taken by Shinde, he said.The CM and his deputies also rubbished Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut&#39;s claim about Shinde meeting Union Minister Amit Shaha at 4 am in Pune to complain against Fadnavis.Shinde said Shah is a leader of the BJP-led NDA. Pawar asserted that it was a courtesy call at 10 am. Fadnavis said he too was present in the meeting.Raut in his weekly column Rokhthok in the Sena (UBT) mouthpiece &#39;Saamana&#39; on Sunday claimed the meeting took place at a hotel in Pune&#39;s Koregaon Park on February 22. Shinde who is a leader of 57 MLAs had to stay awake till 4 am to meet Shah, he claimed.Fadnavis said Raut wants to compete with Salim-Javed, the iconic screenwriting pair of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, while Shinde claimed there was chemical locha (imbalance) in the head of the Sena (UBT) leader.Amid disagreement over guardian ministers&#39; posts to taking separate review meetings to separate medical cells and war rooms&#39; for monitoring projects, there were reports of unease between Fadnavis and Shinde.When asked about his don&#39;t take me lightly remark, Shinde said he had already clarified that it was directed at those who took him lightly and how he taught them a lesson, in a veiled reference to Uddhav Thackeray.Fadnavis added, I don&#39;t take Shinde lightly so the remark was directed at those who underestimated him. He also lashed out at the opposition for boycotting the customary tea party on the eve of the assembly session.Referring to a letter by the opposition, Fadnavis said, It runs into nine pages. It has the names of nine opposition leaders of which seven have signed. All issues mentioned are based on newspaper reports and if they had read the government&#39;s response to these articles, the opposition couldn&#39;t have written even a half-page letter.They said the government should have a dialogue with the opposition.

We have already clarified about the demand for Munde&#39;s resignation, he said.Agriculture minister Kokate was recently convicted by a magistrate&#39;s court in a forgery case and sentenced to two years in jail. A sessions court in Nashik that has suspended his sentencing will give its decision on Kokate&#39;s plea seeking a stay on the magistrate&#39;s order on March 5.Munde has been facing opposition heat after the arrest of his close aide Walmik Karad in an extortion case related to the murder of Beed sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.When told that Congress leader Sunil Kedar&#39;s legislature membership was being terminated, Fadnavis said the decision was taken after the court refused to stay his conviction.

Shinde then joined hands with the BJP and formed government.The editorial in Saamana said 40 MLAs in Maharashtra had defected, leading to the formation of an &quot;extra-constitutional&quot; government. The episode was widely publicised, culminating in a legal battle in the Supreme Court, it pointed out.&quot;Slogans about &#39;khoke&#39; (use of money power) echoed across the state. Kunal Kamra merely rehashed this in a parody song, so what was new? It was &#39;old wine in a new bottle&#39;,&quot; the Marathi publication said.Yet, Shinde&#39;s supporters got so agitated that they stormed the studio (where Kamra&#39;s show was filmed), it said.&quot;The backlash not only embarrassed Shinde but also made him a subject of ridicule in Maharashtra. Meanwhile, the BJP and Fadnavis are quietly enjoying the spectacle,&quot; the editorial claimed.But it is unfortunate that in the process, Maharashtra itself has been dragged into this &quot;farce&quot;, it stated.The Marathi daily recalled PM Modi&#39;s recent statement in a podcast that &quot;criticism is the soul of democracy&quot;.&quot;Yet, even before his words could resonate, a pro-Modi Shinde group attacked and destroyed a podcast studio, striking at the very foundation of free speech. Death threats were issued against Kamra, raising serious concerns about law and order in Maharashtra,&quot; it said.What was the Maharashtra home minister (Fadnavis) doing? Where was the police when chaos unfolded in Mumbai? Were they silent spectators, or worse, complicit in the act? the editorial questioned.As soon as the &quot;pro-Modi Shinde group&quot; vandalised the studio, the Mumbai civic body swiftly arrived with bulldozers, demolishing several structures under the pretext of they being illegal, it said.&quot;The civic body conveniently realised these violations only after the studio was used to criticise the government. The picture is grim for Maharashtra,&quot; it added.The editorial also asked why satire should provoke such an &quot;extreme response&quot; and why an atmosphere of lawlessness and fear should be created in Mumbai.&quot;It has become evident that Fadnavis is a weak home minister.

Talking to reporters in Kolhapur, Pawar said the decision on who will be the chief minister can be made after the poll results are out.The NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) president insisted he wants the MVA to complete the seat sharing process and start the poll campaign at the earliest. &quot;MVA leaders should sit for talks from September 7 to 9,&quot; the Rajya Sabha MP said, adding he expects the election process to be completed by the second week of November.

Last month, Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had demanded that the opposition alliance name its CM candidate before the polls and he was ready to back any name announced by allies Congress and NCP (SP).But the Congress had disagreed with Uddhav Thackeray, saying there was no need for a CM face before the elections. Pawar had then said his party wasn&#39;t interested in the top post and made it clear the MVA&#39;s focus should be on giving an alternative to people and defeating the ruling Mahayuti alliance.

We certainly did not make 100-200 phone calls,&quot; Pawar clarified.Fadnavis emphasised the opposition and ruling parties are political opponents and not enemies.Earlier this month, Gore moved privilege motions against Kharat, Pawar and Shiv Sena (UBT) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut in the assembly, accusing them of maligning his image in connection with the 2017 case in which he was acquitted.Fadnavis remarked that the privilege committee has become &quot;toothless&quot;.&quot;It is the same set of people who insult the House, speak against it. They act in a way to pressure ministers so that they do not work in a free and fair manner,&quot; the CM claimed.Referring to controversial remarks made by stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra, Fadnavis said there was a discussion in the assembly about the comments belittling Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde.Then, again a Shiv Sena (UBT) leader read out the same modified lyrics (used by Kamra) to needle the House, the CM maintained.&quot;This means 288 members of the House have no value.

In view of the ban on their operations in several parts of the country, many banned Maoist organisations have shifted their headquarters to Maharashtra, with their affiliated groups now operating in urban areas,&quot; he said.&quot;Failing to introduce this law could lead to significant challenges for Maharashtra in the future,&quot; the chief minister added.The bill was introduced during the winter session of the state legislature last December.The chief minister said to ensure public awareness and transparency regarding the proposed law, the bill was reviewed by a joint committee and a public hearing was conducted.Fadnavis assured that if journalist organisations propose any amendments or suggestions to this law, appropriate measures will be taken to incorporate them. He further said efforts would be made to clarify provisions of the law.&quot;If an organisation commits an illegal act detrimental to the nation&#39;s security or propagates the ideology of Maoist groups, actions could be taken against such an organisation only after a hearing before an advisory committee comprising three judges, preventing the misuse of the law,&quot; said Fadnavis, who also holds the Home portfolio.Additionally, the CM said police authorities would have to substantiate their claims before this committee, proving the organisation&#39;s actions threaten internal security.&quot;Only upon confirmation would the organisation face action or a ban,&quot; he said, reiterating that the law does not target individuals or journalists.The Maharashtra Special Public Security Bill, 2024&#39; bill, which will become the first law to tackle Naxalism in the state, proposes to give several powers to the government and the police machinery in combating unlawful activities. All offences registered under this Act will be cognisable and non-bailable.The bill describes unlawful activities as indulging in or propagating acts of violence, vandalism or other acts generating fear and apprehension in the public.Indulging in or encouraging the use of firearms, explosives or other devices, encouraging or preaching disobedience to established law and its institutions is also an unlawful activity, it said.An unlawful organisation is one which indulges in or bets or assists, gives aid, or encourages directly or indirectly any unlawful activity.Association with an unlawful organisation will attract a jail term from three to seven years and a fine of Rs 3 to Rs 5 lakh, as per the bill.An advisory board will decide whether or not there is sufficient cause for declaring an organisation as unlawful. It will submit a report to the government in three months.All offences under this act will be cognisable and non-bailable.

This comes just days after the company removed his content and took his name off its list of artists.&nbsp;Posting the letter on X (formerly Twitter), Kamra said he understands why BookMyShow needs to stay on good terms with the government. &ldquo;I know that Mumbai is a major hub for live entertainment,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Without the state&rsquo;s cooperation, iconic shows like Coldplay and Guns N&rsquo; Roses wouldn&rsquo;t be possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;However, Kamra pointed out that the issue isn&rsquo;t just about being removed from the platform. &ldquo;By not allowing artists to list their shows through their own websites, you have effectively prevented me from accessing the audience I have performed for from 2017 to 2025,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;BookMyShow, run by Bigtree Entertainment Private Limited, took down Kamra&rsquo;s content after a controversy over his parody song mocking Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde. In a recent performance at Mumbai&rsquo;s Habitat studio, Kamra sang a version of the song &lsquo;Bholi Si Surat&rsquo;, calling Shinde a &ldquo;gaddar&rdquo; (traitor).&nbsp;Shinde had led a rebellion in 2022 that split the Shiv Sena and led to the fall of the Uddhav Thackeray government. Thackeray and his supporters have often used the term &ldquo;gaddar&rdquo; for him.&nbsp;Angered by Kamra&rsquo;s act, Shinde&rsquo;s supporters reportedly vandalised the Habitat studio in Khar, which later shut down. The next day, parts of the venue were demolished by civic authorities, citing building violations. Many believe the action was linked to the controversy. Kamra now faces several legal cases and has been granted interim protection from arrest by the Madras High Court after skipping three police summons.&nbsp;In his letter, Kamra also highlighted the financial burden on comedians. &ldquo;You take a 10 per cent cut of the revenue for listing shows, which is your business model&hellip; we are all compelled to spend between 6,000 to 10,000 rupees a day on advertising to reach our own audience,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp;He urged the platform to either reinstate him or hand over the audience data from his solo shows. &ldquo;Please ensure that you hand over the contact information of the audiences you&#39;ve collected from my solo shows so that I can continue living my life with dignity and work towards a fair livelihood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The least I deserve, should you choose to delist me, is access to them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Kamra added that while the platform may cite data privacy concerns, &ldquo;the question of who protects what data, and from whom, is a much broader conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Sena leader Rahool Kanal, who had earlier asked BookMyShow to stop promoting Kamra, thanked the platform for removing him. &ldquo;Thank you for keeping your portal clean&hellip; because we all being Mumbaikars love and believe in every form of art but not personal agendas,&rdquo; he said.", "keywords": ["Kunal Kamra", "BookMyShow controversy", "Kunal Kamra open letter", "Kunal Kamra parody song", "Eknath Shinde controversy", "Kunal Kamra BookMyShow ban", "stand-up comedy India", "Kunal Kamra solo shows", "Kunal Kamra audience data", "BookMyShow ticketing issue", "Habitat studio vandalism", "Eknath Shinde gaddar", "Mumbai comedy scene", "Kunal Kamra legal cases", "Kunal Kamra interim protection", "freedom of expression India", "Shiv Sena split", "Kunal Kamra censorship", "comedy and politics India", "Kamra Bholi Si Surat parody"], "date": "2025-04-07T18:15:53+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040700928", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:46"},

He is not poor or illiterate. Why are you (present PIL petitioner) fighting his cause? He has taken action for relief,&quot; the HC observed.&nbsp;The PIL, filed by law student Harshwardhan Khandekar, contended filing FIRs against a comedian for expressing his political views was violative of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. His lawyer Amit Katarnwaware said several politicians belonging to a party which is an ally in the state&#39;s ruling coalition have warned of action against anyone who shares or uploads Kamra&#39;s video containing jokes directed at Shinde.&nbsp;Public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar told the bench the government has not taken any action against any person who has shared or uploaded the video. The court took note of this statement and observed there have been no instances where state authorities have taken any &quot;vindictive&quot; action against any person who has shared the video made by Kamra (36), who himself uploaded it last month. &quot;It is also pertinent to note that the aggrieved person (Kamra) has already approached this court seeking to quash the FIR. He has also got interim protection from arrest from the Madras the HC,&quot; the bench pointed out.&nbsp;In respect of the vandalism of the studio where the stand-up show was shot, an FIR has been lodged and the accused persons have been arrested, it maintained. &quot;In view of this, we are not inclined to entertain this PIL at this stage and hence the same is disposed of,&quot; the court said. Late last month, 12 Shiv Sena workers were arrested for vandalising the Mumbai studio where Kamra&#39;s comedy was shot. They were later granted bail by a city court. During the show, Kamra had taunted Shinde, without taking his name, using a modified version of a popular Hindi song from the 1997 film &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; where he called him a &quot;gaddar&quot; (traitor).&nbsp;The comedian referred to Shinde&#39;s early profession in Thane before he entered politics and also made references to his rebellion against then-Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in June 2022.

We hope that there are no more similar shocks in the future,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Sworn in for a third term as chief minister, the 54-year-old dismissed concerns about the two-week delay in government formation, which stemmed from resistance by Eknath Shinde&rsquo;s Shiv Sena. The party had pushed for Shinde to assume the top role, citing the welfare initiatives under his leadership that contributed to the alliance&rsquo;s electoral success.&nbsp;Fadnavis said that changes in leadership roles had not affected their working relationship. He referred to the role of chief minister as a &ldquo;technicality&rdquo; on previous occasions.&nbsp;&ldquo;In 2014, I was the chief minister, and Shinde was with us. In 2019, for 72 hours, Ajit Dada and I were chief minister and deputy chief minister. After that, Shinde was the chief minister, and Ajit Dada and I were deputy chief ministers. Now I am the chief minister, and they both are deputy chief ministers,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;He further said, &ldquo;Our roles have changed, but the direction is the same, the pace is the same...

Today, on the occasion of the oath ceremony, I say the pace at which Maharashtra is going, we will not stop. We have to make sure that all the decisions are well-thought, made at the same pace,&rdquo; the chief minister said.&nbsp;The &lsquo;shocks&rsquo; mentioned by Fadnavis referred to significant political events, including the Shiv Sena split in 2023 when Shinde&rsquo;s faction overthrew the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government and allied with the BJP. Later that year, Ajit Pawar&rsquo;s defection from the Nationalist Congress Party, led by Sharad Pawar, marked another turning point, as he joined the government.&nbsp;The Mahayuti alliance overcame initial setbacks during the Lok Sabha elections, and achieved a decisive victory in the Assembly polls. Fadnavis said that the victory reflected the alliance&rsquo;s governance and promised an even brighter future for Maharashtra.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a government of very fast decisions.

I am the ocean, I&rsquo;ll return&rdquo;)&nbsp;Those were the words of Devendra Fadnavis in 2019, a poetic yet resolute declaration when he faced the collapse of his short-lived government in Maharashtra. In just 80 hours, the alliance with Ajit Pawar crumbled.&nbsp;Cut to December 2024: Fadnavis returns as Maharashtra Chief Minister as a leader of the Mahayuti coalition. As the face of the BJP&rsquo;s campaign in the Maharashtra Assembly election this year, his leadership has been widely acknowledged. Sharing photos with victorious party members, posting reports of his leadership, and recalling his own prophetic words, Fadnavis has been showcasing his triumphant return.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maharashtra CM oath taking ceremony LIVE Updates&nbsp;With his comeback secured, Fadnavis has again invoked another statement, likening himself to Abhimanyu, the warrior who penetrated the formidable Chakravyuha despite overwhelming odds. This comparison highlights the resolve that defined Fadnavis&rsquo;s political journey. However, despite the thrill of personal victory, Fadnavis is keenly aware that this phase will not be about grand narratives. Now, as the newly reappointed chief minister, his primary challenge will be managing a three-pronged coalition with varying power centers.&nbsp;Fadnavis&rsquo;s path to Maha CM&rsquo;s chair&nbsp;Devendra Fadnavis&rsquo;s rise to power in Maharashtra has been nothing short of remarkable. In 2014, he was unexpectedly chosen as the chief minister of Maharashtra at the age of 44. He had been serving as the state BJP president, and with the BJP securing its largest-ever tally of 122 seats, he emerged as the most logical choice to lead the government. Despite his youth and relative inexperience, Fadnavis had already built a reputation for being clean, credible, and capable. His Nagpur roots and deep ties to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh further strengthened his position.&nbsp;In his first tenure, Fadnavis faced skepticism, particularly because the Shiv Sena, which had been in power with the BJP since 1995, found itself playing second fiddle to the BJP in the state government. Despite initial doubts, Fadnavis won over his critics, proving that his leadership style could harmonise with the varied political landscape of Maharashtra.&nbsp;The highlights of his first term were marked by economic success, particularly in the area of industrial growth. Fadnavis presided over landmark events such as the &lsquo;Make In India Summit&rsquo;, which saw Maharashtra sign 2,603 MoUs worth Rs 8 trillion in various sectors, including automobile, electronics, and infrastructure. The &lsquo;Magnetic Maharashtra&rsquo; event in 2018 further solidified Maharashtra&rsquo;s standing as an industrial hub, with investments worth Rs 12 trillion.&nbsp;In the face of a growing Maratha reservation movement, Fadnavis displayed political tact, engaging with Maratha leaders and implementing a reservation bill &mdash; albeit one that was later stayed by the courts. His deft handling of complex political issues like this reinforced his image as a capable leader.&nbsp; &nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Devendra Fadnavis&#39; name on oath ceremony invitation card surprises public&nbsp;Fadnavis&rsquo;s roller-coaster political career&nbsp;The 2019 elections marked a dramatic turning point for Fadnavis. The BJP, which had formed a coalition government with the Shiv Sena, faced an unexpected challenge. Despite securing a total of 161 seats&mdash;well beyond the majority mark &mdash; further negotiations broke down over the sharing of the chief minister&rsquo;s position. Uddhav Thackeray&rsquo;s Sena split with the BJP, resulting in a period of political instability.&nbsp;In a surprising move, Fadnavis was sworn in as chief minister with Ajit Pawar of the NCP as his deputy. This was an audacious attempt to form a government, but it lasted only 80 hours before Pawar reverted to his uncle Sharad Pawar, and Fadnavis was forced to step down.&nbsp;Despite the shock of this brief stint, Fadnavis&rsquo;s political acumen remained undeniable. He took the setback in stride and kept plotting his return. Throughout the following years, Fadnavis worked tirelessly as the Leader of the Opposition, all while orchestrating the fall of Uddhav Thackeray&#39;s government through the defection of Shiv Sena MLAs led by Eknath Shinde. This strategic maneuver paved the way for Fadnavis&rsquo;s return to power in 2022.&nbsp;However, his return was far from smooth. The BJP leadership decided to make Shinde the chief minister to boost his political stature, relegating Fadnavis to the role of deputy chief minister&mdash;a position that many saw as a &quot;downgrade.&quot; Yet, Fadnavis swallowed his pride and worked within the constraints of this new power-sharing arrangement.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Teacher remembers &#39;back bencher&#39; Fadnavis as kind, polite, helpful student&nbsp;Fadnavis&rsquo;s leadership amid challenges&nbsp;Despite challenges, Fadnavis&rsquo;s leadership never wavered. After a disappointing result in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where the BJP&rsquo;s tally in Maharashtra dropped significantly, Fadnavis once again focused his efforts on party consolidation. He played a crucial role in energising the party machinery in the run-up to the Maharashtra Assembly elections, holding 75 rallies across the state to rally the party&rsquo;s morale.&nbsp;This intense campaigning effort paid off, and the BJP-led Mahayuti secured an impressive 132 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly. As BJP spokesperson Shivaray Kulkarni notes, Fadnavis&rsquo;s commitment to the party above all else was key to the success. &ldquo;Fadnavis has always put the organisation above everything,&rdquo; Kulkarni said.&nbsp;As Fadnavis prepares for his new tenure as Maharashtra&rsquo;s chief minister, the real work begins. Managing a three-way coalition&mdash;especially with the presence of power centers like the Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar&rsquo;s NCP&mdash;will require political shrewdness, diplomacy, and effective governance.&nbsp;Amruta and Devendra: A power duo&nbsp;Fadnavis&rsquo;s personal life offers a glimpse into the determination that has defined his career. His mother, Sarita Fadnavis, reflected on her son&rsquo;s relentless dedication during the election campaign. &ldquo;His success is a result of hard work, which has been his strength, and his unwavering commitment,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;As Fadnavis steps back into the limelight, his wife Amruta Fadnavis&mdash;an accomplished banker and social worker&mdash;has also been gaining recognition for her work in both the social and cultural spheres. Known for her work as a singer and performer, Amruta&rsquo;s rising profile is as notable as her husband&rsquo;s political journey.&nbsp;What next for Devendra Fadnavis?&nbsp;As he takes charge as the Chief Minister again, the focus will be on the practical aspects of governance &mdash; balancing the interests of his coalition partners, managing the state&rsquo;s economic recovery post-pandemic, and responding to the needs of an ever-evolving electorate.&nbsp;And, one thing is certain: Devendra Fadnavis has proven that, like the ocean, his political tides are far from over.

We have communicated this to Devendra Fadnavis,&rdquo; Samant told reporters, ending the suspense surrounding Shinde&rsquo;s role in the new Maharashtra cabinet.&nbsp;A delicate power balance&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to this decision was anything but smooth. Shinde had initially resisted confirming his cabinet position, reportedly dissatisfied with the BJP&#39;s refusal to concede the coveted home portfolio and the Assembly Speaker position for a Shiv Sena legislator. Over the past two days, Fadnavis held multiple rounds of discussions with Shinde to iron out the differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, Shinde accompanied Fadnavis to Raj Bhavan but remained non-committal about his decision. &ldquo;I am yet to make up my mind about joining the government,&rdquo; he had told reporters at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressure from within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shiv Sena legislators played a pivotal role in persuading Shinde to accept the deputy chief minister position. On Thursday morning, Samant revealed that MLAs had expressed their solidarity with Shinde, even threatening to forgo their ministerial aspirations if their leader stayed out of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after this revelation, senior BJP leader Girish Mahajan visited Shinde at his residence, signalling a final push towards resolving the deadlock.

Since 1993, the chief ministership has see-sawed between Congress&#39;s Lalthanhawla and MNF&#39;s Zoramthanga.In a landmark victory, the ZPM swept the polls in Mizoram by bagging 27 seats. The MNF could only manage to secure 10 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) bagged two seats, while the Indian National Congress (INC) only managed to win a single seat. With this, it will be the first time that a political party other than the Congress or the MNF will be voted into power since the state&#39;s formation in 1987.Lalduhoma&#39;s political journeyAfter completing his graduation, he qualified for the Indian Police Service in 1977. The home ministry transferred him to New Delhi as the security in-charge of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1982.Tryst with CongressHe resigned from the police service and joined Congress in 1984. Lalduhoma was then appointed as the vice-chairman of the Mizoram State Planning Board. The same year, he was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP). But after falling out with the Congress leadership, he resigned and lost his Lok Sabha membership. He became the first MP to be disqualified under the anti-defection law in India. He later said that it was a decision he was &quot;very proud&quot; of.Mizo National UnionIn 1986, Lalduhoma formed the Mizo National Union (MNU), which later merged with the Mizoram People&#39;s Conference (MPC) and was made working president.&nbsp;Zoram Nationalist PartyHe briefly joined the Mizo National Front (MNF) but broke away to form the Mizo National Front (Nationalist), which was renamed the Zoram Nationalist Party (ZNP) in 1997. In the 2003 election, he was elected to Mizoram Legislative Assembly from Ratu.Zoram People&#39;s MovementThe ZPM was formed as an electoral alliance of six minor parties in 2017. Zoram Nationalist Party (ZNP), Mizoram People&#39;s Conference (MPC) and Zoram Exodus Movement (ZEM) were the initial members in August 2017. Mizoram People&#39;s Party (MPP), Zoram Reformation Front (ZRF) and Zoram Democratic Front (ZDF) joined the alliance later.In July 2019, ZPM officially registered with the Election Commission of India (ECI). The ZPM had contested 35 seats in the 2018 assembly elections and won eight seats. Ahead of the assembly polls, the ZPM emerged as a serious threat to MNF&#39;s reign in the northeastern state. The ZPM won all 11 wards in the newly formed Lunglei Municipal Council in 2023, which was a major blow to the MNF.Joining Zoram People&#39;s Movement and disqualification as MLAIn 2018, Lalduhoma and his party became a part of the ZPM. The ZPM could not obtain recognition from the Election Commission of India (ECI) as an official party in 2018, so Lalduhoma contested as an independent candidate. He won from two constituencies, Aizawl West I and Serchhip.Lalduhoma was then disqualified as an MLA under the anti-defection law after MNF legislators filed petitions seeking Lalduhoma&#39;s disqualification on the grounds he had contested the 2018 state elections as an independent but later joined ZPM. With this, Lalduhoma became the first member of the Mizoram assembly to be disqualified in the history of the state. But the ZPM left its stamp on Mizoram&#39;s electoral landscape with Lalduhoma&#39;s win in the Serchhip by-election in 2021.In the 2023 elections, the ZPM relied on years of anti-incumbency against both the Congress and the MNF, along with the clamour for change from Mizo youth.

Additionally, the ECI has published a detailed FAQ on its website covering various aspects of EVM battery use, including battery types, the use of alkaline cells, differences between EVM power packs and mobile phone batteries, EVM functionality independent of operating voltage, and explanations for why the power pack status sometimes reads 99 per cent even after a full day of polling.The ECI strongly cautioned against making false generalizations and unfounded allegations against EVMs, which have repeatedly withstood scrutiny in judicial forums and serve as the backbone of India&#39;s voting system. The Commission pointed out instances where the Congress has singled out routine aspects of EVM functioning or electoral procedures and cast them as new issues.Citing 42 judgments from Constitutional Courts that have examined these matters and affirmed faith in EVMs, the ECI reiterated the robustness of India&#39;s electronic voting system, which has facilitated diverse political outcomes across elections.Following the Haryana Assembly election results, Congress leaders KC Venugopal, Ashok Gehlot, Jairam Ramesh, Ajay Maken, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and other senior party members met with Election Commission officials.They presented a list of 20 complaints, including seven written complaints from specific constituencies. The Congress raised concerns over discrepancies in EVM battery levels, stating that some machines showed a 99 per cent battery level while others ranged from 60-70 per cent on the day of counting. The party demanded that these machines be sealed and secured until an investigation could be completed.", "keywords": ["ECI rejects Congress' allegation over irregularities in Haryana polls; calls them \"baseless", "misplaced\""], "date": "2024-10-29T23:49:29+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124102901352", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:54"},

When we export, can we claim duty drawback and Rodtep (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products) on the total payment that we get in foreign exchange?&nbsp;No.&nbsp; Drawback and Rodtep will be available only against export of goods. At the time of export of goods, you must declare the value of the goods in the shipping bill.

The amount that represents the payment for services will not earn any drawback or Rodtep for you.&nbsp;Can we avail of advance authorisation, duty drawback and Rodtep on the same shipment?&nbsp;Yes, in specific situations. Para 4.15 of FTP says that drawback as per rate determined and fixed by Customs authority in terms of Department of Revenue (DoR) Rules shall be available for duty paid imported or indigenous inputs (not specified in the norms) used in the export product. For this purpose, applicants shall indicate clearly details of duty paid input in the application for Advance Authorisation.

Also, as per Para 4.08 of the FTP, the value of any other inputs used on which benefit of DBK is claimed or intended to be claimed must be taken into account for value addition calculations. At the time of shipment, you must file a DEEC-cum-drawback shipping bill and opt for Rodtep at the rates allowed for shipments in discharge of export obligation under advance authorisation. After shipment, you must file a brand rate application for determination of the drawback rate for the duty paid inputs used in the manufacture of the export product.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have obtained an EPCG authorisation naming a supporting manufacturer in whose factory the capital goods imported under the authorisation will be installed.

Pre-election surveys had largely predicted a Congress win, and initial vote counts set off celebrations at Congress headquarters.After early trends came in, members of the grand old party were seen joyfully dancing to dhol beats and sharing jalebis in celebration of their anticipated victory. However, as the day progressed, the BJP began to gain momentum, ultimately clinching the win. This turn of events led to the word &#39;jalebi&#39; trending on social media, with BJP supporters using the treat to mock the Congress.Some BJP leaders shared images of themselves enjoying jalebis, while others tried their hand at preparing sweets to commemorate the party&#39;s triumph. In a widely circulated video, a BJP member from Assam was seen bringing a box of jalebis to the Congress office in Lakhimpur.In addition to photos, a post on X (formerly Twitter) by BJP Haryana featured a screenshot of a food delivery order. The order, placed on Swiggy, was for 1kg of jalebis from Bikanervala in Delhi&rsquo;s Connaught Place and was set to be delivered to Rahul Gandhi&#39;s residence on Akbar Road.&nbsp;\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u0939\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u092b \u0938\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0947 \u0918\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u091c\u0932\u0947\u092c\u0940 \u092d\u093f\u091c\u0935\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u0939\u0948???????? pic.twitter.com/Xi8SaM7yBj&mdash; Haryana BJP (@BJP4Haryana) October 8, 2024The authenticity of the post could not be verified by Business Standard.The image showed the order being prepared and noted that payment would be made in cash upon delivery.

I am bringing a box of jalebi for you too,&quot; he had said, adding that the sweet shop should open its &quot;factories&quot; across the world.BJP leaders were quick to point out that jalebis are traditionally handmade, not produced in factories.Haryana election resultsThe BJP performed well across Haryana, particularly in urban areas, winning 48 seats with a vote share of 39.94 per cent. This marked an improvement over its 2014 tally of 47 seats and its 2019 vote share of 36.49 per cent.While a consolidation of non-Jat votes contributed to the party&rsquo;s success, it also managed to secure victories in constituencies where the farming community held sway. The new BJP government will face the challenge of delivering on its significant promises, including creating jobs, providing a monthly allowance of Rs 2,100 to women, and ensuring a minimum support price for 24 crops.Meanwhile, the Congress, led by former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Haryana, expressed doubts over the election outcome. The party claimed a conspiracy, stating that &quot;democracy lost while the establishment won&quot; in Haryana.

The dedicated e-com portal is being developed by the UPSIDA, and will connect raw material suppliers, manufacturers, and finished goods vendors operating out of these 155 clusters.&nbsp;Reducing reliance on external suppliers and cutting costs, the proposed e-marketplace can facilitate direct business-to business transactions, fostering trade and business alliances among the UP-based units.&nbsp;&ldquo;The e-market is a step towards realising the &lsquo;Make in UP&rsquo; vision.

Within 90 days of the supply, the merchant exporter had customs clear the goods and obtained the &lsquo;let export order&rsquo;. He had also delivered the goods to the shipping line and obtained the &lsquo;on board&rsquo; bill of lading dated before expiry of 90 days from the date of supply. However, the shipping line filed the EGM after 90 days. Now, the audit team demands full IGST from us on the grounds that the goods were not exported within 90 days from the date of supply. We seek your guidance on how to deal with such a patently unreasonable demand.&nbsp;I think the auditors are relying on Section 2(5) of the IGST Act, 2017 which says that &lsquo;export of goods&rsquo; with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means taking goods out of India to a place outside India. Also, they are demanding the full IGST from you on the basis of Para 2 of the said notification 41/2017 which says that the&nbsp; &nbsp;registered&nbsp; &nbsp;supplier&nbsp; &nbsp;shall&nbsp; &nbsp;not&nbsp; &nbsp;be&nbsp; &nbsp;eligible&nbsp; &nbsp;for&nbsp; &nbsp;the&nbsp; &nbsp;above&nbsp; &nbsp;mentioned exemption if the registered recipient fails to export the said goods within a period of ninety days from the date of issue of tax invoice. In my opinion, you may take a plea that date of exports is not defined in the GST laws and that as per Para 11.12 (i)(b) of HBP, for containerised cargo, the date of shipment/export is the date of &lsquo;on board bill of lading&rsquo;. The GST department may not accept such a plea but it is likely that the Courts will give you suitable relief as the goods have, in fact, been exported and not filing EGM in time is not the fault of the exporter.&nbsp;We refer to your article titled &lsquo;unnecessary confusion on continuation of Rodtep scheme for exporters&rsquo; (Business Standard &ndash; 13th January 2025). The ICEGATE is now carrying a message stating &lsquo;Rodtep Scheme for SEZ/EoU/AA exports has been extended until 29.01.2025 as an interim measure to facilitate trade&rsquo;. We find no notification of such extension. Can you please clarify the correct position?&nbsp;The correct position is that till now the scheme is not extended for SEZ/EoU/AA exports beyond 31.12.2024. My guess is that the ICEGATE message is to enable you to opt for the scheme while filing the shipping bill. It is possible that clarity will emerge on extension of the scheme for such exporters in the next few days.&nbsp;We refer to the Notification No. FEMA 10(R)(5)/2025-RB dated January 14, 2025.&nbsp; Can you explain how it helps exporters?&nbsp;That notification now allows exporters to open foreign currency accounts outside India to receive export proceeds and utilise the funds for making payments for imports.

When the counting of postal ballots took place, the Congress was winning, but when the counting of EVMs started, the opposite happened,&quot; former chief minister Hooda told reporters after the meeting.He said the Congress will submit more complaints to the EC in the next few days. &quot;The EC has assured us of looking into the matter,&quot; Hooda said after meeting the CEC and other election commissioners.Bhan also said that doubts have been created about the veracity of the counting exercise in Haryana and they should be cleared by the EC.Khera said party leaders Maken and Singhvi have urged the EC to conduct a thorough probe, pending which it should ensure that the EVMs with discrepancies are sealed and secured till then.&quot;We apprised the Election Commission about 20 complaints that have come to us, including seven written complaints from seven constituencies with some EVM machines functioning at 99 per cent battery capacity, while some EVM Machines were functioning below 60-70 per cent battery capacity,&quot; he said.&quot;Maken and Singhvi have demanded that the EVMs for which complaints have been made be sealed and secured till the inquiry into the whole matter is completed. We also told the EC that in the next 48 hours, we will make available to them other complaints that are being compiled.&quot;All the machines for which complaints have been made should be sealed and secured till the inquiry is completed. The EC has told us that they will give a written reply to us on all constituencies after consulting the respective returning officers,&quot; Khera added.&quot;Counting of votes in a fair, transparent and accountable manner is the hallmark of any electoral process that claims to be in consonance with the principles of free and fair elections and the doctrine of the level-playing field as envisaged by the Constitution,&quot; the party memorandum to the EC said.&quot;Considering that the said issue could potentially alter the results for some Assembly constituencies, we request that this Hon&#39;ble Commission take urgent measures and order for an enquiry on this issue. In fact, subject to the enquiry report, the Hon&#39;ble Commission should issue requisite directions regarding the counting of polls and final results,&quot; it also said..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}", "keywords": ["Haryana elections", "Congress", "ECI", "Haryana", "JP Nadda", "Bharatiya Janta Party", "BJP", "Congress"], "date": "2024-10-09T21:34:37+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124100901071", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:02:59"},

Bulk of India&rsquo;s seafood exports to the US is in the form of &ldquo;Vannamei Shrimp&rdquo;, and some estimates said that in FY24, almost 41 per cent of India&rsquo;s shrimp exports went to America, which was by far one of its largest markets.&nbsp;Till now, the maximum tariff imposed by the US on shrimp exported from India was around 8 per cent, which, following the new tariff of 27 per cent, could go up to 45 per cent after adding countervailing duty (CVD), etc., trade sources said.&nbsp;Seafood is one of India&rsquo;s largest agricultural exports after basmati rice and buffalo meat.&nbsp;Among other agricultural items that are exported in a big way, basmati rice is a prominent one and the US buys around 300,000-350,000 tonnes of the rice variety from India every year.&nbsp;Other items, such as oilseeds, castor oil, processed fruits, spices, and cashew, could also see a drop in exports because of high prices and shift towards Brazil whose tariff is relatively lower than India. But when it came to seafood and basmati rice, experts didn&rsquo;t foresee any long-term negative impact of the tariffs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Instead of a negative impact, I see a small positive impact on Indian seafood and basmati exports to the US due to the tariff change,&quot; NITI Aayog Member Ramesh Chand told Business Standard.&nbsp;A similar fate also awaited agro-chemicals exports from India to the US.&nbsp;In FY24, as per industry estimates, India exported around $5.5 billion worth of agro-chemicals globally, of which the US alone accounted for $1.1 billion (around 20 per cent).&nbsp;Here, too, industry experts said that the duty differential between India (6 per cent) and China (24 per cent) has got further distorted after the tariff hikes, which has made Indian products even cheaper despite being slightly higher priced compared to Chinese products.&nbsp;&ldquo;Even if the manufacturing cost of Indian agro-chemicals is higher than China, the tariff difference nullifies that,&rdquo; Dr Kalyan Goswami, director general of Agro Chem Federation of India, said.&nbsp;Chand was of the view that when it came to seafood exports, major Indian competitors include countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and the tariff hikes in those countries have been much more than India.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, it is not that in the short run, the US will sharply produce seafood and even if they want to build their domestic capacities, it will take time. These new tariffs would make the products costlier for US consumers, which could lead to some dampening effect on demand, but it will be temporary,&rdquo; Chand said.&nbsp;But seafood industry players reacted negatively to the news of the tariff hike, with shares of most major listed companies falling sharply.&nbsp;India, experts said, might now start looking at markets such as China, Europe, and West Asia for its shrimp exports.&nbsp;&ldquo;There could be significant impact of such high tariffs on the shrimp market in the US, and supermarkets might run dry of shrimps. But once US grocery stores run low, shrimp prices will adjust,&rdquo; Nitin Awasthi of InCred Equities told Business Standard.&nbsp;He said that there could be short-term panic, long-term reset! &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how this plays out,&rdquo; Awasthi said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In case of basmati rice, I feel that impact could be for two-three months and things could normalise after that,&rdquo; said Vijay Sethia, a former president of the All India Rice Exporters Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["US reciprocal tariff", "Indian shrimp exports", "seafood export India", "US India trade", "vannamei shrimp duty", "Ashok Gulati trade view", "InCred Equities shrimp market", "rice export to US", "Vijay Sethia rice export", "global trade barriers", "agriculture exports to US"], "date": "2025-04-04T00:28:17+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040300312", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:03:05"},

In addition to Kanugolu, the team includes P Chidambaram, Mukul Wasnik, Jairam Ramesh, KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Randeep Singh Surjewala.According to some reports, the poll strategist is also credited with organising Rahul Gandhi&#39;s Bharat Jodo Yatra, a march that covered over 4,000 kilometres from India&#39;s southernmost coast to Jammu and Kashmir. The yatra is believed to have been a pivotal initiative by the grand old party that resulted in several recent election outcomes tipping points.Looking ahead, Sunil Kanugolu&#39;s major tasks include restoring the Congress&#39;s political fortunes in Telangana, retaining Congress governments in upcoming elections in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, leading the Congress to victory in Madhya Pradesh, and, most importantly, transforming the Congress into a formidable and winning contender against the PM Modi-led BJP in the 2024 general elections.", "keywords": ["Karnata Elections Results 2023", "Karnataka Assembly Election Results 2023", "Karnataka Results 2023", "Karnataka Vidhan Sabha 2023", "Karnataka Legislative Assembly", "Karnataka Elections", "Congress", "Karnataka Polls Results 2023", "Karnataka Polls", "prashant kishor", "sunil kanugolu", "who is sunil kanugolu", "poll strategist"], "date": "2023-05-15T10:03:45+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "123051500192", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:03:14"},

We are optimistic &mdash; we withstood the pandemic and multiple geopolitical crises,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mishra also touched upon challenges posed by &lsquo;protectionism and trade disputes&rsquo;, noting that discussions around reciprocal tariffs are intensifying. However, he described Modi&rsquo;s recent visit to the US as &ldquo;very positive,&rdquo; particularly in negotiating a military deal and strengthening economic ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mishra argued that it&#39;s time for India to look beyond resilience and adopt an &lsquo;anti-fragile&rsquo; approach to uncertainty. &ldquo;Before designing policy, we must analyse risks and uncertainties. Risks can be calculated, but uncertainty &mdash; such as the Covid-19 outbreak or the war in Ukraine &mdash; cannot be easily measured. Our systems should not just be resilient but anti-fragile,&rdquo; Mishra said. &nbsp;&nbsp;The global economic landscape is shifting, with many nations ensuring they manufacture essential goods domestically. &ldquo;Many countries &mdash; consciously or unconsciously &mdash; are making sure they are manufacturing for critical needs,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp; India&rsquo;s demographic size and economic standing provide a strong foundation to navigate these uncertainties. &ldquo;We are one of the world&rsquo;s largest economies in absolute terms, with a vast consumption base and a demographic advantage. With our digital public infrastructure and technological capabilities, we should be able to sustain external pressures and negotiate from a position of strength,&rdquo; Mishra said.&nbsp; He stressed that India would continue to focus on bilateral, regional, and multilateral relationships in the evolving global trade environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;Agriculture remains crucial to India&rsquo;s growthContrary to the belief that agriculture loses relevance as a country develops, Mishra emphasised that the sector remains crucial for India despite shifts in its economic structure. &ldquo;Agriculture is of utmost importance. It will not become less important as we climb the ladders of development,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;While agriculture&rsquo;s share in GDP has declined, Mishra said its role in employment generation remains largely unchanged. &ldquo;We cannot claim that no progress has been made in agriculture over the past few decades. There was a time when we relied on external assistance for food grains. Today, we are exporters. Agricultural exports are a crucial component of this progress,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He also highlighted the resilience of agriculture, noting that the sector has continued to grow despite inherent risks. &ldquo;By nature, agriculture is not averse to risks. However, after 2014, the rate of agricultural growth has increased. Horticulture, fisheries, and the dairy sector are also growing,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp; Emphasising the role of diversification in Indian agriculture, Mishra pointed to the importance of non-farm income. &ldquo;We are encouraging farmers, especially those with less than half an acre of land, to diversify their income through non-farm activities. The government seeks to increase non-farm income,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Aatmanirbhar Bharat", "India self-reliance", "global supply chains", "economic uncertainty", "Covid-19 impact", "Russia-Ukraine war", "West Asia crisis", "trade protectionism", "reciprocal tariffs", "India-US relations", "military deal", "economic resilience", "anti-fragile systems", "policy design", "global trade", "bilateral agreements", "multilateral trade", "India economy", "digital public infrastructure", "demographic advantage", "agriculture in India", "agricultural exports", "non-farm income", "food security", "horticulture growth", "fisheries sector", "dairy industry", "India development", "Prime Minister Modi", "Pramod Kumar Mishra", "BS Manthan summit", "geopolitical challenges", "supply chain disruptions"], "date": "2025-02-27T15:19:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022700574", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:03:16"},

From advanced engineering and data analytics to cutting-edge seismic processing, India continues to drive innovation in energy exploration and production.&nbsp;Notable breakthroughs from previous editions, such as crude oil tank sludge cleaning, industrial biotechnology in upstream and downstream operations, and eco-friendly batteries, further highlight the country&rsquo;s progress in energy sector transformation.&nbsp;Puri acknowledged the unpredictability of the evolving global energy framework, emphasising the need for strategic recalibration. While short-term profitability remains a priority, long-term energy transition efforts continue. However, he dismissed the notion of an outright hydrocarbon phase-out, arguing instead for a balanced energy mix where oil and gas will still play a stabilising role in power generation, hydrogen production, and energy storage.&nbsp; Climate change, he warned, is no longer a distant threat but a present-day reality, manifesting in wildfires, floods, and extreme temperatures. As global energy investments exceed $3 trillion, of which $2 trillion is directed towards clean energy technologies, India must ensure its transition is both just and equitable. Energy justice, he stressed, is the foundation of this transformation; an inequitable shift could widen disparities between developed and developing economies.&nbsp;Three forces, according to Puri, will shape the global energy landscape: artificial intelligence (AI), clean cooking solutions, and strategic investment diversification. AI-driven digital expansion, expected to power a $400 billion Indian digital economy by 2030, presents both an opportunity and a challenge. With data centre energy demand projected to rise by 18&ndash;20 per cent annually, ensuring grid stability while meeting climate commitments is crucial. He highlighted that AI itself could enhance fossil fuel efficiency, ensuring a smarter energy future where intelligence, not just resources, dictates security.&nbsp;Clean cooking, another pivotal aspect, demands a multi-fuel approach, integrating LPG, BioNG, electrification, and decentralised renewables. India has already achieved 100 per cent clean cooking access through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and solar cooking solutions. Scaling these successes will require policy innovation and targeted investments.&nbsp;India&rsquo;s energy investment potential remains vast, with 7.6 billion tonnes of discovered upstream resources, 500 million tonnes of biofuel feedstock, and a rapidly expanding renewable sector targeting 5 million metric tonnes of hydrogen by 2030. The minister called for smart capital reallocation, deploying wind and solar where intermittency is manageable, biofuels for liquid fuel demand, and gas as a stabilising force.&nbsp;&quot;The future of energy is not about choosing between hydrocarbons and renewables but about leveraging both strategically to ensure affordability, security, and sustainability,&quot; Puri remarked.&nbsp;Ultimately, Puri&rsquo;s address set the tone for India Energy Week 2025, advocating for a pragmatic, innovation-driven approach that balances economic growth, environmental responsibility, and energy security in an increasingly complex global landscape.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["India Energy Week 2025"], "date": "2025-02-11T19:48:34+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021101490", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:03:16"},

So we are insisting with every researcher that they need to take the development of (the product) they are doing to a TRL 7 at least when they have a choice to start their own venture or hand it over to a startup to take it from there,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The eight-year target to develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1,000 physical qubits is no longer relevant, Chowdhry said, adding that these targets will need to be revised.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is something we are seriously discussing within the mission to say how we can improve on the targets originally planned. The world is changing and there is so much innovation going on in quantum today,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The development of new materials such as Microsoft&rsquo;s Majorana 1, a topoconductor, is a major challenge as they will be computing power at the right qubit level much faster than originally thought, Chowdhry said.&nbsp;The country also needs to think about the uptake of the semiconductor chips that are being made in India as most of these silicon chips will be for exports. To solve this issue, the government will also need to shift focus to designing in India. To encourage the uptake of India-made semiconductor manufacturing chips, all government purchases must be only for Indian chips.&nbsp;India, however, does not need to set up the most advanced units to make bleeding edge semiconductor chips as the country neither has the need nor the money needed to make such units functional, he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In making semiconductors, the RoI (return on investment) takes 10 years. So, you put up a plant like TSMC, it takes up to five years to come up, the investment will be huge and returns will not be there because TSMC will have gone up further,&rdquo; he added.", "keywords": ["BS manthan", "BS manthan summit", "Business standard annual summit", "India technology sovereignty", "strategic autonomy", "quantum technology India", "EPIC Foundation", "Ajai Chowdhry", "HCL co-founder", "emerging technologies India", "tech independence", "India innovation", "deep tech India", "national security technology", "quantum computing India", "indigenous technology development", "digital transformation India", "self-reliant India tech"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:13:36+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022800907", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:00"},

The panel, featuring distinguished experts, provided valuable insights on strengthening safety protocols, leveraging automation, and fostering a resilient workforce.&nbsp;Shivendra Parihar, joint director at the Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD), explored how human factors play a crucial role in improving HSE performance. As the key interface between the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and industry stakeholders, OISD is committed to setting and enforcing safety norms through structured audits, training initiatives, and regulatory frameworks. Parihar emphasised the need for leadership commitment, robust organisational structures, and clear performance indicators to drive a culture of proactive risk management.&nbsp;He also underscored the importance of effective communication in accident prevention, citing past industrial disasters where miscommunication led to catastrophic consequences. Clear, multilingual instructions, structured shift handovers, and open feedback channels are essential to maintaining workplace safety and operational excellence.&nbsp;Dr Sandeep Sharma, chief general manager (HSE-Medical) at IndianOil Corporation Ltd, introduced a pioneering approach to petroleum storage tank cleaning using robotic scavenging machines. This innovative solution eliminates human exposure to confined, hazardous spaces, significantly improving both safety and efficiency. These automated systems also facilitate the complete recovery of hydrocarbons from sludge, promoting environmental sustainability. Dr Sharma highlighted how automation in high-risk tasks not only reduces operational downtime but also aligns with global safety and environmental compliance standards, setting a new benchmark in the industry.&nbsp;Dr Deepashri Nage, deputy general manager at Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, addressed the pressing challenge of corrosion under insulation (CUI), which accounts for a significant percentage of industrial equipment failures. She explained that CUI can progress up to 20 times faster than atmospheric corrosion, leading to leaks, shutdowns, and even explosions. As a solution, she presented thermal insulating coatings (TICs), an in-house innovation designed to combat this issue. Unlike conventional insulation, TICs offer dual benefits: superior CUI protection and enhanced personnel safety, while also reducing maintenance costs and improving energy conservation. Advancements in materials science, she noted, are key to revolutionising infrastructure longevity and operational reliability.&nbsp;Dr Rama Srinivasan, chief general manager (HR) at GAIL (India) Ltd, highlighted the growing need for mental health support in high-risk industries. He stressed the direct correlation between demanding job roles and mental fatigue, advocating for structured support systems within energy companies. By incorporating psychological research and industry-specific case studies, he illustrated how chronic workplace stress can impair decision-making, increase safety risks, and diminish overall productivity. Practical strategies, such as resilience training, dedicated mental health programmes, and the integration of wellness professionals into corporate frameworks, are essential to fostering a more supportive work environment.&nbsp;Srinivasan Ramesh, general manager at ONGC, introduced the &lsquo;Five Tatwas&rsquo; framework, a holistic approach aligning mental and physical health with the elements of nature&mdash;earth, water, fire, air, and ether. He explored how emotional states impact physical health, citing links between anger and liver health, grief and lung function, and stress with cardiovascular strain. Ramesh advocated for neurobics, mental exercises incorporating mudras, colours, and mantras, to stimulate specific energy centres (chakras) and counteract workplace stress. His session underscored the growing recognition of holistic wellness practices in enhancing employee performance and overall organisational health.&nbsp;The session concluded with the consensus that a robust safety culture, effective communication, technological innovation, and mental health initiatives must go hand in hand to create a sustainable and secure energy sector.", "keywords": ["Safety and Sustainability"], "date": "2025-02-12T15:18:40+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021200895", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:02"},

He was speaking at the Business Standard annual event &ldquo;Manthan&rdquo;.&nbsp;The Aayog has submitted a report to the government both on oilseeds and pulses wherein it has talked of faster and quicker adoption of new technologies, such as transgenic, to lower dependence on imports.&nbsp;&ldquo;Despite having the highest soybean-growing areas in the country, our yields have stagnated at the same levels as they were in the 1970s. The growth of oilseed production in India has not kept pace with consumption growth, and without embracing advanced technology, it will be difficult to reduce dependency on imports,&rdquo; Chand said.&nbsp;Speaking at a panel discussion on &ldquo;Is Agriculture India&rsquo;s Strength Or Weakness&rdquo;, experts said although agriculture is India&rsquo;s strength, yet it faces many challenges, and raising farmers&rsquo; income is prime among them as it is minuscule when compared to that of government employees.&nbsp;Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman of Bharat Krishak Samaj, said: &ldquo;We as farmers take pride in our work, we are also deeply hurt by how government policies have treated us.&rdquo;&nbsp;&quot;To put things in context, I feel policymakers suffer from what I would call &lsquo;selective memory loss&rsquo;. They tend to overlook the challenges farmers face. The elephant in the room is the comparison between the incomes of farmers and salaries of government employees. I think this is an important question that should be raised in the coming months,&quot; Jakhar said.&nbsp;He said around 45 per cent of Indians, or approximately 65 crore people, depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Of these, 60-70 per cent earn less than \u20b910,000 a month. Non-agricultural income excluded, a staggering 85 per cent of these farmers earn less than \u20b910,000 a month, he stressed.&nbsp;&quot;Now, on the other side of the spectrum, we have the 8th Pay Commission, which will soon determine salary increases for 50 lakh government employees and 65 lakh government pensioners. These figures are significant, and I don&rsquo;t envy government employees. Rather, I regret the situation that the farmers I represent find themselves in,&quot; Jakhar said.&nbsp;Chand meanwhile said that to&nbsp; address the question as to why he believes agriculture is India&#39;s strength, there are a few key points. Despite the growing mechanisation in agriculture, labour remains the major input. Secondly, though global conversation around agriculture has shifted towards &lsquo;food systems&rsquo; or &lsquo;agri-food systems&rsquo;, India has been practising a mixed crop-livestock system for centuries now, adding another key strength is the diversity of Indian agriculture.&nbsp;He further said that one of the greatest strengths of Indian agriculture is the responsiveness of small farmers to modern technology and inputs, which often exceeds that of larger farmers on a per-acre basis. Chand said while there are challenges that Indian agriculture faces, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses.&nbsp;The third expert on the panel, C S C Sekhar, professor, Institute of Economic Growth, said that while agriculture remains a strength for India at the national level &mdash; especially in terms of food self-sufficiency &mdash; there is a pressing need to ensure that this strength translates into tangible benefits for the farmers who form the backbone of this sector.&nbsp;Sekhar said in the long run, there is no alternative but to ensure that people move out of agriculture into more productive sectors.&nbsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s crucial that this transition is not simply about moving people from agriculture to low-paying, unskilled jobs like MGNREGA labour. There must be a focus on skills development, so they can move up the value chain and contribute to more sustainable, higher-paying employment opportuNITIes,&rdquo; Sekhar said.", "keywords": ["BS Manthan", "India agriculture challenges", "farmers' income disparity", "agriculture sector reforms", "Business Standard Manthan", "NITI Aayog agriculture policy", "Ramesh Chand economist", "edible oil demand India", "genetically modified crops", "GM crops India", "farm income vs government salary", "agricultural technology adoption", "Indian farming sector", "Eight Pay Commission impact", "agricultural sustainability", "agrarian economy India"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:20:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022801125", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:02"},

There might be some blips and ups and downs, but from a startup perspective, India is in a golden age. The kind of adoption and hunger for technology, combined with the capabilities within operators and teams to build solutions, is unprecedented.

We should look at an ecosystem evolving over a few decades, not just a couple of years.

But that cycle has changed,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;Following the funding boom of 2022, the Indian startup ecosystem has struggled to raise similar amounts. In 2021, startups raised $37.7 billion, followed by $25.9 billion in 2022. Since&nbsp;Also Read: BS Manthan: India must make itself quantum secure, says HCL cofounder&nbsp; then, funding has continued to decline, with startups raising $10.9 billion in 2023 and $11.4 billion in 2024, according to Tracxn data.&nbsp;As a result, there has been a stronger focus on business sustainability, he said. &ldquo;Everywhere, the conversation around making money in a sustainable manner has increased, shifting the mindset of founders and operating teams. The conversation is no longer just about securing funds or acquiring customers but about the long-term value of customers,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;In the Indian startup ecosystem, there were only two unicorns in 2023 and six in 2024. The logistics AI solutions company Netradyne became the first unicorn of 2025. A unicorn is a privately held startup valued at $1 billion or more.&nbsp;Echoing Sharma&rsquo;s and Setia&rsquo;s views, Puneet Singh Jaggi, co-founder of electric ride-hailing firm BluSmart, said: &ldquo;If we are able to build the right business, the narrative follows. Every time we see a boom, there will be a parallel bust a couple of years later. These are standard market cycles. What matters is keeping consumers, suppliers, and teams happy. As long as this happens, you will build businesses that persevere and last for generations.&rdquo;&nbsp;The leaders agreed that digitisation and technology adoption have been fundamental to the growth of startups.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["BS Manthan", "BS Manthan summit", "India startup ecosystem", "funding winter", "Indian unicorns", "startup growth optimism", "Business Standard Manthan", "innovation in startups", "resilience in business", "sustainable business models", "capital influx", "Indian startup golden age", "technology adoption in India", "startup investment trends", "Anshoo Sharma", "Magicpin CEO", "hyperlocal e-commerce", "venture capital in India", "startup funding trends", "entrepreneurship in India", "tech-driven startups", "business scalability"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:23:54+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022801041", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:02"},

We have the largest market for some of the products we manufacture, a large pool of labour, and we can excel in design and manufacturing. We have shown that our manpower can be the most productive in the world compared with many other countries if given the right inputs,&rdquo; Vachani said, speaking at the second edition of Business Standard Manthan.&nbsp;Of the total $140 billion worth of electronics products consumed in the country, domestic units make products worth $110 billion. Information and communication technology (ICT) products are also the third-largest category of goods in India&#39;s export basket, with the country expected to export ICT products worth $40 billion, including mobile phone exports of $20 billion, he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now the question that needs to be asked is: when do we deepen manufacturing? What will happen to the value addition in all the products? When do we start designing these products? I think these are the questions to ask now,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The 56-year-old chairman and managing director of Dixon Technologies, which is among the largest home-grown white-label electronics manufacturers, believes that the component manufacturing ecosystem will also come to the country over time with the patience of the electronics industry.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t around at that time, but I am sure the same question was asked when Maruti started manufacturing cars for the first time in India. Many would have said that this is only assembly for now, and asked when the component ecosystem would arrive. But today, about 40 years later, the auto components sector exports products globally,&rdquo; Vachani said.&nbsp;The American College London graduate started Dixon in 1993 with money borrowed from his father. By his own admission, the senior Vachani gave him not just the money but also sent Atul Lall, a trusted lieutenant, along with his good wishes.&nbsp;The debate around value addition, especially for mobile phones, is somewhat misplaced, he said. For example, while some say that domestic value addition in India is only 20 per cent, even in countries like Vietnam, where mobile phone production is much higher, the total value addition is only about 25 per cent.&nbsp;Similarly, in China, which is the world&rsquo;s largest producer of both feature phones and smartphones, the value addition is only about 50 per cent, Vachani said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We at Dixon have also announced our project for manufacturing display modules, eventually setting up a display fab. We are also entering the manufacturing of camera modules and mechanicals,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s journey from a rented manufacturing facility in Noida to 24 facilities across the country today has become a poster story of the prowess of domestic manufacturing in India.&nbsp;Dixon initially started by assembling cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions for Lucky-Goldstar (now LG) and has now expanded its portfolio to include televisions, smartphones, feature phones, telecom equipment, refrigerators, smartwatches, washing machines, and security and surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, along with information technology hardware.&nbsp;&ldquo;So we are confident that in the next couple of years, we will increase value addition from 20 per cent to about 30-35 per cent. That is a big deal for both the country and the company,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Though Dixon has proven itself in the electronics manufacturing industry by quickly becoming one of the top white-label product makers in the country, there are aspects such as backward integration, scale, product design, and digital transformation where domestic companies can still learn from Taiwan&#39;s electronics manufacturing powerhouses, Vachani said.&nbsp;The company was listed on stock exchanges in 2017 and recorded a turnover of Rs 12,192 crore in 2022-23, a growth of over 90 per cent year-on-year. A champion of the government&#39;s Make in India initiative, Vachani&rsquo;s Dixon was one of the first companies to receive approval under the flagship production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for mobile phones.&nbsp;From a modest 80,000 mobile handset units, the company has grown to a capacity of producing over 70 million handsets annually. The company will begin production of the first display modules in October this year, which make up about 8-10 per cent of a mobile phone&rsquo;s bill of sale value.&nbsp;Apart from that, the company plans to launch another plant for manufacturing camera modules, which account for 7-8 per cent of a mobile phone&rsquo;s total value, he said.&nbsp;The expected changes in tariff structures imposed or likely to be imposed by the United States on China and some other nations present India with an unprecedented opportunity, Vachani said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The US imports LED televisions worth about $10 billion. They also import mobile phones worth almost $60 billion and IT hardware worth nearly $80 billion. If Indian companies were to capture even a fraction of this market, we would not be able to set up enough capacity to meet this kind of demand,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Though this surge in demand could be disruptive for the domestic electronics manufacturing industry, India must also resolve the issue of reciprocal taxes and sign free trade agreements (FTAs) that cover Indian products,&rdquo; Vachani said.&nbsp;Industry groups and associations are in discussions with the government on reciprocal taxes and have suggested that India delay reciprocal tariffs until FTAs are finalised, he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am confident that for products like IT hardware and laptops, where even Taiwanese companies are slowly moving up the value chain to servers, there exists a huge opportunity for Indian companies&mdash;not just in manufacturing but also in design and components.&rdquo;", "keywords": ["Sunil Vachani", "Electronics industry", "ICT", "Dixon", "Dixon Technologies", "BS Manthan"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:26:22+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022800778", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:08"},

We are again stuck in, as it were, a model that saved us from hunger but which now needs to evolve. There&rsquo;s already a lot of risk in agriculture, so I don&#39;t want to seem hard-hearted but I think that putting crop agriculture and horticulture on more or less an even path,&rdquo; Bery said, in response to a query about the major challenges the country&rsquo;s policymakers are seeking to tackle.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a large agenda which will need to be undertaken in research and technology in terms of agriculture, he noted, adding that India&rsquo;s increasingly young workforce poses another challenge.&nbsp;&ldquo;Getting a balance between what has been happening in higher education and meeting the aspirations of the people who have come out of our higher education system and providing them with jobs of the kind that they feel they are entitled to, even if they may not be, is a giant enterprise&hellip;&nbsp; It&#39;s an enormous labour market with a very high degree of informality. And how you push all of this to a labour market system which encourages investment in training is an enormous challenge,&rdquo; said Bery in a fireside chat.&nbsp;The V-C of the Aayog added that a major challenge in the way of this endeavour is that manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital intensive. Moreover, female labour force participation will be a key driver of growth in the future, he said, adding that there has been progress in women&#39;s employment driven by the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi.&nbsp;&ldquo;Higher productivity means you get the same output for fewer workers. But if your labour force is increasing, then the only way you can absorb them is to grow faster and to employ more people. And our most underutilised resource is women. Now, the PM has been on this from the very beginning and there has been progress on female labour force participation but that could be a huge kind of growth driver,&rdquo; Bery said.&nbsp;India will also have to ensure that it makes faster strides in technology, both through inward-looking interventions and engagements on foreign trade.&nbsp;&ldquo;For us to be at the technological frontier and to benefit from technology &ndash; a lot of which has to be embodied through foreign direct investment &ndash; is a very important dimension of our trade agreements,&rdquo; Bery said. The Union Budget has signalled India&rsquo;s willingness to look again at bilateral investment treaties, he pointed out.&nbsp;Bery also highlighted that it is anybody&rsquo;s guess whether higher tariffs levied by India in the past have helped the Indian economy. Lower tariffs could be one way of achieving 7 per cent and competitive growth for the economy, said Bery.&nbsp;&ldquo;It should not be the case that we do things only because it suits the US. We should use this pretext to do things that are in our interest,&rdquo; Bery said. India has lowered tariffs on several items across sectors in the Budget, as well as subsequently, after US President Donald Trump announced a reciprocal tariff policy.&nbsp;According to the veteran economist and academic, it is too early to tell whether there will be a global reset given current geopolitical developments, but mentioned that India would benefit from Russia being taken away from the Chinese embrace as the US re-establishes dialogue with it after the change of leadership in the US administration.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Europeans have been a little unrealistic. Russia is an important European power. And to, as it were, assume that it can be ostracised forever, I don&#39;t think it is realistic. I think that in a sense, re-establishing dialogue with Russia by the US is probably a good thing (for India),&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The Aayog V-C said that because of recent developments, the European Union (EU) is looking to create options for itself, which is evidenced by the fact that there was a clear commitment to wrap up the free trade agreement by the end of this year in the declaration after Modi met with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday. Bery added that there was emphasis from the president on the fact that India is a valued and trusted partner.&nbsp;On the overall impact of global developments on India, Bery said that India will have to be watchful of this uncertainty. &ldquo;India, as the fifth largest, soon to be the third largest economy in the world, is very much impacted by global growth and global financial conditions: be it the dollar, be it US bond yields, etc. And so these indirect consequences of President Trump are as important for our policymakers to keep an eye on&hellip; because, amongst other things, increased uncertainty is bad for investment globally. And what the world needs because of the challenges of climate change and technology, is a big investment push. India needs a big investment push. And so, to clutter the landscape with a lot of arbitrariness is not good for the global economy,&rdquo; Bery said.&nbsp;The fiscal challenge of climate adaptation, coupled with growth objectives of the country, will need to be addressed going ahead, according to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;The fiscal challenge of financing adaptation while maintaining growth, and by adaptation I mean both chronic adaptation, heat stress, disasters, is trying to maintain a growth rate and having the fiscal means for this is a big challenge. On the energy transition side, financing is the big issue. Another issue is financing a big investment push. I think that while we&#39;re doing quite well in terms of our investment rate, if we want to grow at 7 per cent, it&#39;s going to need to be raised.

The announcement was made at the India Energy Week in New Delhi.&nbsp;It is the second-largest acquisition in the country&rsquo;s renewable energy sector, following Adani Green Energy&rsquo;s 2021 purchase of SoftBank&rsquo;s renewable energy assets in India for \u20b926,000 crore.&nbsp;ONGC-NTPC Green Energy Ltd (ONGPL), a 50:50 joint venture between ONGC Green Limited (OGL) and NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL), completed the transaction. The company acquired stakes from the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), British International Investment Plc (BII) and its subsidiaries, and Eversource Capital.&nbsp;NGEL, the green energy arm of NTPC, was listed on the stock exchanges in September last year.&nbsp;This is ONGPL&rsquo;s first strategic investment since its inception in November 2024. Ayana currently has 4 gigawatts (Gw) of operational and under-construction assets.&nbsp;Sanjay Kumar Mazumder, CEO of ONGC Green Limited, described the acquisition as a major milestone for both public sector firms in their push for clean energy. &ldquo;As two of India&rsquo;s largest Maharatna PSUs, we recognise our responsibility in driving the nation&rsquo;s green energy ambitions. This acquisition propels us forward in accelerating India&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy, leveraging our technical expertise, industry relationships, and financial strength,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;In a joint statement, the companies said the deal aligns with the net-zero targets of ONGC and NTPC, set for 2038 and 2050, respectively. ONGPL now plans to use Ayana&rsquo;s platform to expand further in the sector.&nbsp;&ldquo;This also aligns with our mission of achieving the ambitious target of 60 Gw by FY32 and moving forward to become one of the leading developers of utility-scale renewable energy projects in the country, thereby meeting the expectation of our shareholders at each and every step,&rdquo; said Rajiv Gupta, CEO of NGEL.&nbsp;Ayana was founded by BII in 2018 and later received investment from NIIF and Eversource Capital in 2019. Srini Nagarajan, managing director and head of Asia at BII, said: &ldquo;BII launched Ayana in 2018 to catalyse India&rsquo;s renewable energy sector. Having mobilised over $1 billion in capital alongside NIIF and Eversource, we are proud of Ayana&rsquo;s achievements and excited for its future under ONGPL&rsquo;s leadership.&rdquo;&nbsp;For this acquisition, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP served as ONGPL&rsquo;s transaction advisor, with JSA Advocates and Solicitors providing legal counsel.

Julien Tornare says innovation is key", "content": "&ldquo;Luxury needs to keep pace with time &mdash; it can be rooted in heritage but must also innovate,&rdquo; said Julien Tornare, chief executive officer of Swiss luxury watch brand Hublot, while speaking at the second edition of Business Standard Manthan on Friday. With the discussion themed Can India Create Its Own LVMH? he said there was immense potential for the country to create world-renowned brands.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nobody comes to India to shop,&rdquo; he said. People come to India to experience its culture and heritage. &ldquo;A strong tourism ecosystem can also be used to help visitors experience India&rsquo;s brands.&rdquo;&nbsp;He said that like Swiss watches, known for their craftsmanship, India has a rich tradition of exquisite craftsmanship, whether in textiles or jewellery. &ldquo;The gap lies in turning this craftsmanship and heritage into luxury products that the world is familiar with.&rdquo;&nbsp;He gave the example of Hublot, which is barely 45 years old yet well-known. The Swiss watch industry, Tornare said, is perceived to be very conservative and leans on the past a lot.&nbsp;&ldquo;But even if you use techniques from decades ago, the brand has to communicate with a younger generation and must be innovative and creative in doing so,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Hublot, established in 1980, became a member of the global luxury conglomerate LVMH in April 2008. It opened its first boutique in India in 2019 in Mumbai and has now opened its second boutique in Bengaluru.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hublot is often referred to as the terrible kid of the watch industry. We continue to push the limits, which is key to our competitive advantage,&rdquo; Tornare said, adding, &ldquo;You have to take advantage of who you are but also be contemporary.&rdquo;&nbsp;Talking about how India can build its own globally recognised luxury brand, Tornare said, &ldquo;It is very important for a brand to not only talk about its heritage and story but also show that it will evolve with its clients and remain young.&rdquo;&nbsp;Successful brands thrive on authenticity.&nbsp;&ldquo;When people think of high-end shoes, they think of Italy. For fashion, it&rsquo;s France or Italy. For luxury watches, it&rsquo;s Switzerland. Heritage is a great advantage. These associations create credibility and desirability, but you have to evolve,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Speaking about the Indian luxury market, Tornare, on his first trip to the country, said it is an important market for the brand.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were among the first Swiss watch brands to enter India. Maybe 20 years ago, India didn&rsquo;t have the right environment for luxury brands, but things are developing faster, and the landscape is changing. We see more shopping malls offering the right environment for luxury brands. Entering a market early gives a brand a competitive advantage,&rdquo; said Tornare.&nbsp;&ldquo;New avenues of luxury shopping are still being developed. The country has huge potential for luxury shopping, which will be a way for Indian brands to showcase their expertise and craft,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Tornare also called upon the Indian diaspora to help grow Indian brands globally.&ldquo;Indians are travelling more than ever, and there are Indian communities all over the world. It is important for them to talk about homegrown luxury brands to help people abroad know more about them,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Citing South Korea as an example, he said the country has done a good job of exporting its culture in recent years &mdash; from Korean TV shows to K-pop to several brands, they have become ambassadors for the country.&nbsp;On high taxes on luxury goods in India, Tornare said it is a challenge they have managed in China as well.&nbsp;&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m going to build the brand in India for the long term, and we will continue to invest in India in the coming years. It is among the biggest potential markets for us,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Tornare also spoke about exploring partnerships with Indian chefs, textiles, and even sports.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is important to have a global strategy but also connect with local values. Globally, we work with football, but in India, the sport is cricket. Although many brands are associated with it, we would like to collaborate with the sport in some way. We would also like to collaborate with an Indian chef and contemporary artists, which would be a great way to engage with the local culture,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Also in the works is a limited-edition watch for the country, reinforcing Tornare&rsquo;s belief in India&rsquo;s evolving luxury landscape.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["luxury industry", "Swiss luxury watches", "Hublot CEO", "Julien Tornare", "luxury brand innovation", "Business Standard Manthan", "Indian luxury market", "heritage and innovation", "global luxury brands", "India LVMH potential", "luxury business growth", "premium watch brands", "luxury sector trends", "high-end fashion", "Indian brand building", "luxury market expansion", "international brand recognition", "luxury goods industry", "watchmaking excellence", "bs manthan"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:46:56+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022801134", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:10"},

I think we need to make sure that at the inception and growing stage of the manufacturing sector they need to be supported. Some barriers need to be put in place so that they can grow and reach a scale economically where they can be as competitive as the rest of the world,&rdquo; Singh said.&nbsp;The local content of every megawatt is important, Girish Tanti, cofounder & vice-chairman at the Suzlon Group said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Unlike in the solar sector, where average incidence of local content is still about 20 per cent, in the wind sector, the average local content for the entire industry is already about 64 per cent. And, Suzlon has been running in excess of 75 per cent for more than a decade,&rdquo; Tanti pointed out.&nbsp;He also said that the country needs to keep in mind the security risks associated with imported technology and equipment.&nbsp;A focus on domestic manufacturing has led to domestically produced modules, and the next path is to complete the entire value chain, said Deepesh Nanda, managing director (MD) & chief executive officer (CEO), Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd.&nbsp;&ldquo;The next step is to have domestic cells. Manufacturing capacity is being added in a very systematic, calibrated fashion. We expect that by the same time next year, we should have 25 Gw of capacity on cell,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large projects needed&nbsp;The leaders also argued that while renewable energy is rising at an accelerated pace, there is a need for undertaking ultra mega scale projects. &ldquo;The demand is growing rapidly, but we are still far from where we need to be. That is why we have taken on the challenge of a 30 Gw plant at Khavda, Gujarat, which is well on its way. Today, we reached a milestone, crossing 12 Gw in total portfolio, and we aim to reach 50 Gw by 2030,&rdquo; Singh said.&nbsp;Set to be the world&#39;s largest renewable energy project, the company has operationalised 2 Gw at Khavda till date.&nbsp;&nbsp;India will hit 500 Gw of renewable energy by 2030, and potentially 650 Gw by 2032, Nanda said.&nbsp;The industry is also ready to take on traditional power sources, he stressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;With the advent of complex tenders and the combination of wind, solar and battery storage, and pumped hydro in the near future, I think we can replace the thermal electron one by one, at a significantly lower cost,&rdquo; Nanda said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have 6 Gw of operational projects and are building another 6. This has been done on the back of manufacturing, again supported by the Indian government. So again, full marks in terms of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;The country is self reliant in wind technology, and will account for 10 per cent of global wind equipment supply by 2030, Tanti said.&nbsp;He said a rapid increase in production has led to the total manufacturing capacity of the wind sector reaching 18 Gw, or 3-4 times the annual requirement of India.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing out that the sector is also able to supply globally, Tanti stressed the 21 Gw of capacity that Suzlon has installed worldwide, with almost 5 Gw plus installed in about 17 countries across the globe.&nbsp;Myriad challenges&nbsp;Nanda also flagged the need for significant investment in research and development, given the high rate of obsolescence of technology.&nbsp;&ldquo;India generates 18-20 GWs of solar energy annually, and we must ensure our manufacturing sector supports this growth.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the industry has often fallen short in this area. The PLI scheme has been beneficial, offering incentives worth \u20b92,000 crore &mdash; an advantage few other countries provide,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The known wind potential of India going up by three times over the past three decades is due to higher research into the geography of the country and wind science, Tanti said.&nbsp;He argued that the same is needed for solar distribution and consumer usage patterns. Acquiring large parcels of land for renewable energy projects remains particularly difficult for developers, while the lack of skilled manpower constricts plans, Singh said.&nbsp;He added, &ldquo;We still suffer from not having adequate resources or skilled resources available to us to grow.&rdquo;&nbsp;The corporate leaders also pointed out the challenge of spreading awareness about the power of the renewable sector to create a large number of jobs across the country.&nbsp;&ldquo;It will take a village for us to spread the word, the opportunity in terms of jobs,&rdquo; Nanda said&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructure bottlenecks, uneven availability of financing for the RE sector as well as for large scale projects and stability in policy remain other key demands.", "keywords": ["renewable energy India", "supply chain localization", "domestic manufacturing support", "Business Standard Manthan", "Adani Green Energy", "Amit Singh", "renewable energy hub India", "solar energy supply chain", "ingot wafer production", "polysilicon refining India", "green energy investment", "renewable energy policy India", "manufacturing sector growth", "clean energy infrastructure", "energy transition India"], "date": "2025-02-28T22:31:19+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022800961", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:11"},

She was speaking at a panel discussion titled &ldquo;Future of Jobs&rdquo; during Business Standard annual event &ldquo;Manthan&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, when we look at AI and digital interventions, they are also expected to create jobs in the economy. The integration of AI in the information technology (IT) sector will create more jobs. Tourism and health are additional sectors that are going to drive job growth. Not to mention international mobility,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;Prior to Dawra, Radhicka Kapoor, senior employment specialist at the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s (ILO&rsquo;s) Decent Work Technical Support Team (DWT) for South Asia, emphasised that the augmenting effect of technology is going to be far more significant for the future of work than the automated effect.&nbsp;&ldquo;Basically every occupation entails certain tasks. So, when new technologies like AI, GenAI come in, there would be certain tasks within those occupations that will be automated, not the entire occupation. Therefore, the tasks that will be redundant will then enhance the overall productivity of the occupation. That is the augmenting effect,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Responding to a query on how she views the future of jobs shaping up amid the current technological changes, she brought to notice a global study that looked at the impact of GenAI, and its findings of how these technological changes would have an augmenting effect.&nbsp;Echoing similar views, Hiranmaya Pandya, president of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), said that whenever new technologies come in, new job roles are created inadvertently.&nbsp;&ldquo;For example, during the Covid pandemic, we saw a transformation in the nature of work. The rise of gig and platform work is such an example. Now it is a regular part of our lives. Jobs created only in the government sector are not the only kind of jobs. The private sector, which is growing at a rapid pace, is also generating a lot of jobs,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;Besides, the three panellists also agreed on the importance of upskilling the youth in the changing scenario, where technological changes are making a significant impact. Also, since a large working population is engaged in the informal sector, it is imperative to skill them and formalise them.&nbsp;Responding to a query on the impending launch of the three employment linked incentive (ELI) schemes that were announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget last year, Dawra said extensive stakeholder consultations have happened, indicating that the schemes will be launched soon.&nbsp;&ldquo;The labour ministry budget for this financial year is at a historic high. Around Rs 20,000 crore belongs to these three schemes. So, this should give you a clue,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is a very significant scheme and also has a budget higher than even the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme. So, efforts were made to ensure that the scheme achieved what it was aimed for,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;Responding to a query on the recent debate around work hours, Kapoor said personally she is very cautious about defining what &ldquo;working hours&rdquo; mean in a country like India where a large number of people are self-employed.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Pandya, in response to a query on the future of labour union movement, said that BMS does not give much weightage to strikes as a measure as they believe in bipartite negotiations between the management and the unions as the first resort.&nbsp;&ldquo;In this changing world, strikes are losing their relevance. People are not encouraging such strikes at all. Though this does not mean we should give up our issues. Instead, we should rely on data and present to the management all the issues that we have. In the changing global world, multinational companies are working across the globe. We should gather all this data and present the same to the management. This would save a lot of man-hours, which will be in the interest of both the workers and the management.

While there is a call to shift from the polluting sources to renewables, India feels that move cannot be abrupt, with oil and gas as well as coal continuing to meet energy demand in the period when the cleaner sources are scaled up.&quot;The very notion of &#39;energy transition&#39; requires a nuanced understanding. It is not outright replacement, but more shifting the primacy of one energy source over another,&quot; he said. &quot;The transition isn&#39;t about eliminating hydrocarbons overnight but leveraging them strategically while scaling renewables to mitigate emissions.&quot;&nbsp; For too long, energy transition has to be framed as a linear journey - from fossil fuels to renewables, from past to future, from problem to solution.&quot;Even when renewables become the dominant energy sources, oil and gas will continue to play a pivotal role, not just in power generation but in stabilising grids, industrial hydrogen, and energy storage innovations,&quot; he said.&quot;Energy justice must shape the new energy order. One thing has become absolutely clear to all stakeholders. Energy justice must remain at the core of the imminent transformation.&quot;&nbsp; A fragmented transition risks deepening inequality, leaving billions without reliable energy while wealthier nations surge ahead. &quot;If the transition is not just, it will not succeed because the political economy will not allow it.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone here would disagree with me when I say that last few years - encapsulated in the whirlwind events of 2024 - have left the global energy order in transition. These include major geopolitical shifts.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Nobody can say, with any degree of certainty, what the new framework for global energy markets will look like. But we can be sure that it is going to be transforming at breakneck speed, driven by forces that are both accelerating and colliding,&quot; he said.Puri said the world is witnessing a recalibration of strategy, prioritising near-term profitability while keeping long-term transition efforts in play.&quot;Before anyone accuses me of ignoring our environmental obligations, I must state that the primary focus remains on increasing the adoption of biofuels, renewables, and hydrogen,&quot; he said adding the IEA estimated that global energy investment was going to exceed $3 trillion for the first time in 2024, with $2 trillion going to clean energy technologies and infrastructure.Climate change, he said, is no longer a looming threat. It is unfolding in many grave disasters, wildfires, floods, and record-breaking temperatures are clear reminders that the world is running out of time.The minister said three forces that will play a pivotal role in shaping the energy landscape in the coming years are new drivers of demand - artificial intelligence and clean cooking, balancing immediate challenges with long-term vision and resilient supply chains for an orderly transition.AI, he said, is now one of the largest energy consumers, with data centre demand rising 18-20 per cent annually by 2030. India&#39;s AI-driven digital economy, projected to reach $400 billion by 2030, presents both a challenge and an opportunity. &quot;The real question is not how we will meet this surge in demand, but how we will do so without destabilising grids or derailing climate commitments,&quot; he said.Stating that renewables alone won&#39;t be enough, he said AI-driven demand requires round-the-clock reliability, meaning natural gas, coal with carbon abatement, and next-generation nuclear will remain essential.&quot;But the potential benefits are immense. AI itself will enhance fossil fuel efficiency, reshaping the energy equation where intelligence, not just resources, dictates energy security. The next great energy leap will come from dismantling the idea of centralised energy in the form of AI-driven grids that predict demand before it happens,&quot; he said.On the other hand, expanding clean cooking access requires a multi-fuel strategy, scaling traditional LPG, augmenting bio-CNG, accelerating electrification, and channelling investments into areas such as integrating decentralised renewables like wind-powered micro-grids to support electric and induction cooking.Puri said the answer to energy transition lies in strategic investment across hydrocarbons and renewables. &quot;The future lies in smart capital reallocation,? for instance, deploying wind and solar where intermittency is manageable, biofuels where liquid fuel demand persists, and gas where firm power is essential. That is how we ensure both affordability and decarbonisation.&quot;&nbsp; India presents a compelling and diversified investment landscape, 7.6 billion tonne of discovered upstream resources, 500 million tonne of biofuel feedstock, and rising energy demand. At the same time, it is scaling renewables, targeting 5 million tonne of hydrogen by 2030, $96 billion in hydrogen investments, and a gas share increase from 6 per cent to 15 per cent, alongside $30 billion in refining and petrochemical expansion.He said supply disruptions - whether in lithium for storage, nickel for EVs, or semiconductors for AI-driven grids - must not create winners and losers in the transition. &quot;Without intervention, the growing gap in energy technology access could leave developing economies locked out of the transition. Governments and industries must act decisively to prevent disorderly shifts.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Policy cannot remain static while the world accelerates. Governments must craft frameworks that incentivise bold innovation, de-risk essential investments, and ensure commitments beyond the short term. Success will be measured not by how fast the wealthiest decarbonise, but how inclusively the world transforms,&quot; he added.", "keywords": ["India Energy Week", "Oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri", "renewable energy", "ethanol blending", "E20 petrol", "E100 fuel", "green hydrogen", "Indian Railways net zero", "solar energy India", "photovoltaic cells", "battery storage policy", "hydrocarbons exploration", "sedimentary basin India", "petroleum refining", "energy goals 2030", "sustainable feedstock", "Make in India energy"], "date": "2025-02-11T14:42:39+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125021100885", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:15"},

Even though our marketing companies get upset when the prices go down as it becomes too difficult for them to maintain a healthy balance sheet.&nbsp; However, as a minister, I am very happy with the oil price coming down.&quot;&nbsp;Puri also spoke about his &#39;Trump connection&#39; at the event. He said, &quot;I served for 39 years in the Indian foreign service term. I was a permanent representative to the United Nations. During my time in New York, I had the privilege of knowing President Trump even when he was not the President. I had the privilege of living in the Trump Tower. He used to visit us every year.&quot;&nbsp;When asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss nuclear energy, including small and modular reactors, during his meeting with US President Donald Trump this week, Puri said, &ldquo;Oh absolutely! It is on the agenda.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, the Indian government has pledged billions of dollar for research, and is amending laws to lure private capital and boost the sector&rsquo;s growth. However, the nuclear industry in India has been stymied in part due to safety concerns, but also because of a nuclear liability law that holds operators and equipment suppliers liable for damages in case of an accident.&nbsp;Earlier in the day (February 11), Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated the event. He said that India&#39;s energy sector is pivotal to the country&#39;s growth ambitions. &ldquo;Every expert in the world is saying that the 21st Century belongs to India. India is not only driving its own growth but also driving the world&#39;s growth, and our energy sector plays a very big role in this,&rdquo; PM Modi said in a virtual address to the India Energy Week 2025.&nbsp;Next two decades crucial for India: PM Modi&nbsp;&ldquo;The next two decades are very crucial for &#39;Viksit Bharat&#39;. In the next five years, we will be crossing several big milestones,&rdquo; he said. PM Modi reiterated India&rsquo;s target to add 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity and achieve net-zero carbon emissions for Indian Railways by 2030. &ldquo;Our targets may look very ambitious; however, whatever India has achieved in the last 10 years gives us the confidence that we will achieve these targets too,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;The PM highlighted five key pillars underpinning India&#39;s energy ambitions -- resource harnessing, fostering innovation, economic strength with political stability, strategic geography, and a commitment to global sustainability.&nbsp;Meanwhile, speaking on the sidelines of IEW&rsquo;25, Puri highlighted India&rsquo;s growing stature in the global energy landscape. He added that IEW&rsquo;25 is set to be even larger, more diverse, and more impactful than its previous two editions. Covering over 1 lakh square meters, IEW&rsquo;25 will be the second-largest energy event globally in terms of ministerial and CEO participation, exhibition space, and the number of sessions.&nbsp;Speaking at a press conference on the eve of the event&rsquo;s opening, Puri announced that the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas will host a Clean Cooking Ministerial during the event, bringing together global policymakers, industry leaders, and experts to accelerate the transition to clean cooking solutions.&nbsp;The event will showcase India&rsquo;s success with the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) as a model for global adoption.

Announced on the sidelines of the India Energy Week summit in New Delhi, the round is the largest and spans 13 sedimentary basins and offers 25 blocks, including 19 offshore across 1.91 lakh sq km.&nbsp;This compares with 1.36 lakh sq km of area opened under the preceding OALP IX round. The government has offered acreages spanning a total of 3.78 lakh sq km under the nine previous rounds.&nbsp;The latest round includes 12 blocks in the ultra-deepwater area, six in shallow waters, and one deepwater. OALP X was launched by Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri in the presence of British Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Edward Miliband, Qatar&#39;s Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, and Doto Mashaka Biteko, Deputy Prime Minister of Tanzania.&nbsp;Officials say India is keen to attract foreign bids this time, given the introduction of the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024 in Parliament. The Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha in the last session of Parliament and Lok Sabha has to do so. It clarifies the granting and extension of petroleum leases separate from mining leases, allows for international arbitration, and creates a new dispute resolution mechanism for the E&P sector. More importantly, it introduces a simpler business regime and streamlines approval processes, which global majors like Chevron, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies had previously flagged as challenging.&nbsp;The latest announcement comes more than a year after OALP IX bidding opened in January 2024. It comprised 28 blocks covering an area of approximately 1.36 lakh sq km. The results of the OALP IX round have not been announced: It did not have foreign participation.&nbsp;India&rsquo;s hopes&nbsp;A lot is riding on the latest round. Despite nine OALP rounds, India&rsquo;s national oil production stood at 29.4 million tonnes in 2023-24, lower than the 31.95 million tonnes recorded in 1999-2000. Ageing oil fields like Bombay High and limited success in discovering large new reserves have stagnated crude output since 2011, with annual production hovering around 30-35 million metric tonnes. Both domestic and foreign industry stakeholders have highlighted persistent challenges, including limited reserves, ageing infrastructure, and high exploration costs.&nbsp;India has an estimated sedimentary area of 3.36 million sq km, comprising 26 sedimentary basins. Of this, 1.63 million sq km is on land, 0.41 million sq km is in the shallow offshore area up to 400 metres from the coast, and 1.32 million sq km is in the deepwater area beyond 400 metres. An estimated 10 per cent of these sedimentary basins are under exploration.&nbsp;Under OALP, India allows upstream companies to carve out areas for oil and gas exploration. Exploration companies can submit expressions of interest for any area throughout the year, which are accumulated thrice annually, after which the identified areas are put up for auction.&nbsp;The Centre estimates 651.8 million metric tonnes of recoverable crude oil reserves and 1,138.6 billion cubic metres of recoverable natural gas reserves within India&rsquo;s 3.36 million sq km sedimentary basin. Currently, an estimated 10 per cent of this area is under exploration, with plans to increase it to 16 per cent by the end of 2024.

The BJP, led by its strong organisational machinery and widespread support base, managed to withstand the Congress challenge.While talking to the media during the day, incumbent CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the victory was a result of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s leadership and Amit Shah&#39;s election strategy.Additionally, Chouhan credited the success to the impact of his social welfare initiative, Ladli Behna, stating the scheme had deeply resonated with the people of Madhya Pradesh. &ldquo;The schemes such as Ladli Behna have touched people&#39;s hearts in Madhya Pradesh,&rdquo; he said.Elections for the 230-seat Madhya Pradesh Assembly were held on November 17 and saw a 77.82 per cent voter turnout, 2.19 per cent more than the 2018 elections.

AAP added 590,000 subscribers in the period analysed, with the BJP gaining 530,000 and Congress adding 500,000. TMC&rsquo;s YouTube subscribers grew by 28,000. AAP saw a significant boost in March, adding 360,000 subscribers, coinciding with the arrest of its leader in a corruption case.&nbsp;Despite the dip in subscriber growth, the BJP&rsquo;s official YouTube channel led in cumulative video views, with 432 million views over the three months, followed by AAP with 307.8 million and Congress with 166.9 million. TMC&rsquo;s YouTube channel garnered 93 million views, according to the data.&nbsp;Instagram emerged as the top platform for online ad spending by the BJP and Congress between December 2023 and March 2024. Congress gained over 1.32 million followers, while the BJP added 850,000, and AAP gained 230,000 in the first quarter of 2024. TMC&rsquo;s growth was modest, with just 6,000 new followers.&nbsp;Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained a commanding lead over other Indian leaders across social media. Between January and March, Modi gained 2.6 million followers, far surpassing the 500,000 new followers of Rahul Gandhi. Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee added 100,000 and 52,000 followers, respectively, on X during the same period.&nbsp;&gt;Digital strategies&nbsp;The BJP connected with voters by sharing a personalised &lsquo;Letter from the Prime Minister&rsquo; via WhatsApp, a platform with over 500 million monthly active users in India. The message highlighted the achievements of the Narendra Modi-led government and invited voter feedback. Additionally, the party launched the &lsquo;My First Vote For Modi&rsquo; website, where users could pledge their support for Modi, upload videos explaining their choice, and access short clips showcasing development initiatives under the NDA government.&nbsp;Similarly, the Congress ran a Rahul Gandhi WhatsApp group to facilitate interactions between the leader and the public, where he reportedly addressed queries.&nbsp;The Election Commission of India (ECI) also recognised the importance of digital engagement by launching campaigns aimed at young voters. Initiatives like &lsquo;Turning 18&rsquo; targeted first-time voters through social media outreach, emphasising the role of digital platforms in shaping electoral participation.&nbsp;Data from the Election Commission reveals that during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP spent Rs 325 crore on media advertisements, including print, electronic, bulk SMS, cable websites, and TV channels, while the Congress spent Rs 356 crore on similar campaigns.&nbsp;&gt;A sea of memes on social media&nbsp;Political parties increasingly embraced memes as a powerful tool for engagement during elections, using humour and cultural references to resonate with voters. Here are some of the most memorable memes from recent elections:&nbsp;The confused math lady: This meme became popular among voters trying to make sense of the complexities of political alliances and party splits.&nbsp; BJP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Same same, but different&rsquo; series: The BJP used this meme format to highlight perceived similarities between rival politicians, such as Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee, juxtaposing them with humorous images. This series gained significant traction on social media, getting over 140,000 likes on Instagram.&nbsp; Election Commission&rsquo;s Bollywood-inspired memes: The Election Commission of India joined the meme trend by creating content that encouraged voter participation. One notable meme featured a young Amir Khan from the film Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, promoting the idea of voting with pride.&nbsp; Money Heist references: In Telangana, political parties like the BJP and TRS engaged in a meme war using visuals from the popular series Money Heist to critique each other&rsquo;s policies.&nbsp;AAP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Jail ka jawab vote se&rsquo;: Following the arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) used memes to rally support, urging voters to respond to his arrest by voting against rival parties.&nbsp;&gt;Micro-targeting and analytics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of AI-driven analytics allowed parties to micro-target specific demographics with tailored messaging. For instance, the BJP employed sophisticated data analysis to identify voter preferences and craft messages that resonated with different segments of the electorate. This approach maximised campaign impact but also contributed to the formation of online echo chambers that reinforced partisan beliefs among voters. The Congress similarly leveraged analytics to focus on youth and marginalised groups, tailoring their messages accordingly.Artificial intelligence in campaigning&gt;Uses of AI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2024 elections saw a significant infusion of AI technologies into campaign strategies. Political parties reportedly allocated around $50 million to develop AI-generated content, including deepfakes aimed at influencing voter perceptions. For example, the BJP shared an AI-made video featuring one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s main opponents in a humorous light, while the INC created parodies mocking PM Modi&rsquo;s policies.&nbsp;A notable example of deepfake misuse was a video of Amit Shah, altered to falsely suggest that the BJP opposed all forms of reservations, misrepresenting the party&rsquo;s actual stance. Another case involved a deepfake voice of Mahatma Gandhi, endorsing a political party, raising concerns about exploiting deceased figures for political gain. During the elections, deepfakes featuring celebrities like Ranveer Singh and Aamir Khan falsely showed their endorsement of certain parties. Despite their denials, these videos gained traction on social media, showcasing the ease with which misinformation can spread, influencing voters.&nbsp;Additionally, AI tools were used for predictive analytics to identify swing voters and deliver hyper-personalised messages through robocalls and chatbots.&nbsp;&gt;Challenges posed by AI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its advantages, the use of generative AI raised concerns about misinformation and electoral integrity. The Indian government acknowledged these risks; officials warned that AI-generated content could undermine democracy by spreading deceptive narratives. The Election Commission struggled to regulate these technologies effectively, relying on tech companies for self-regulation amid fears of manipulated media proliferating unchecked.Digital engagement strategies&gt;Citizen journalism and independent platforms&nbsp;In response to a stifling traditional media environment dominated by pro-government narratives, many politicians turned to independent digital platforms. Individuals like Ravish Kumar gained popularity as citizen journalists on YouTube, providing alternative viewpoints that engaged directly with audiences. This shift allowed Opposition members to bypass traditional media gatekeepers and connect more authentically with voters.&nbsp;&gt;Virtual campaigning amid challengesThe extreme summer heat posed challenges for physical campaigning; thus, virtual engagement became a necessity. Online events replaced political rallies, allowing parties like the BJP and the Congress to reach voters without logistical challenges posed by weather conditions. This change not only facilitated broader participation but also highlighted the importance of digital literacy among voters.Electoral integrity concerns&gt;Misinformation and regulation issuesThe rapid evolution of digital campaigning raised significant concerns regarding misinformation. The widespread use of social media for political messaging led to increased scrutiny over the accuracy of information shared online. Many voters found it challenging to discern credible sources from unreliable ones in a landscape filled with competing narratives.&nbsp;&gt;Government response and regulatory challengesWhile there were calls for stricter regulations on digital campaigning practices, enforcement remained lax. The Election Commission&rsquo;s warnings against deepfake usage highlighted the need for better regulatory frameworks to address these emerging challenges effectively.Shaping democracy in digital timesThe general elections in 2024 marked a turning point in the role of digital technology in political campaigns. Social media platforms, AI-driven strategies, and digital engagement tools became central to electioneering, offering multiple opportunities for voter outreach and mobilisation. However, these advances were accompanied by challenges, including the spread of misinformation, deepfake content, and concerns over electoral integrity. As India navigates this new digital landscape, balancing innovation with responsible governance will protect democratic processes in future elections.", "keywords": ["2024 Indian General elections", "digital campaigning", "social media influence", "AI in elections", "31 december", "last day of 2024", "WhatsApp campaigns", "Narendra Modi", "Rahul Gandhi", "political memes", "micro-targeting", "deepfakes", "electoral integrity", "Election Commission of India", "voter engagement", "BJP digital strategy", "Congress social media", "AAP online presence", "Instagram ad spending", "YouTube political content", "artificial intelligence in elections", "political parties digital spending", "political ads India", "misinformation regulation", "citizen journalism", "digital literacy", "virtual campaigning", "social media analytics", "India internet users", "election participation", "AI-generated content", "social media growth", "deepfake concerns", "2024 Lok Sabha election", "digital political outreach", "political memes India", "digital advertising India"], "date": "2024-12-31T12:47:48+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124123100308", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:11:24"},

Trump on Wednesday (local time) voiced optimism for striking a deal with China.&nbsp;His remarks come amid the escalating tensions between two strong economies of the world. Trump on Wednesday (IST) raised China&rsquo;s reciprocal tariffs to 125 per cent after the latter retaliated and imposed 84 per cent tariffs on US imports.&nbsp;What did Trump say?&nbsp;Speaking to reporters at the White House, the US President lauded his Chinese counterpart, announcing that there is still scope for dialogue between the two countries. It is worth noting that ever since Trump came to office for his second term, he has yet to speak with Jinping, making it the longest period in 20 years that a US president has gone without contact with their Chinese counterpart.&nbsp;Calling Xi &ldquo;one of the smartest people in the world&rdquo;, Trump told reporters that he (Xi) is a man who knows what needs to be done exactly.

The abrupt decision stirred fears of an intensifying global trade conflict, led to a sharp downturn in financial markets, and added concerns about a potential worldwide economic slowdown. Despite this pause, Trump also declared an immediate hike in tariffs on Chinese imports, raising the rate to 125 per cent from the earlier stated 104 per cent.&nbsp; The Trump administration imposed a steep 125 per cent tariff on all goods coming from China, prompting Beijing to retaliate with new import taxes of 84 per cent on all American products. This escalation marked another spike in the ongoing trade dispute between the world&#39;s two largest economies, contributing to renewed market instability.&nbsp;&ldquo;I did a 90-day pause for the people who didn&rsquo;t retaliate because I told them if they retaliate, we&rsquo;re going to double it,&rdquo; Trump said while announcing the increased tariffs targeting China.&nbsp;Despite the pressure, China responded firmly by raising its import tariffs on US goods to 84 per cent, up from the previous 34 per cent, as a counter to Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy.

According to the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua, the 84 per cent tariff on US imports took effect at 12:01 pm on Thursday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rationale behind the tariff pauseExplaining the decision to pause the reciprocal tariff, Trump mentioned that more than 75 countries had refrained from taking retaliatory action against the US. He framed the move as a strategic step to give negotiations a chance.&nbsp;&ldquo;...based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives of the United States... to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non-Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorised a 90 day PAUSE,&rdquo; Trump wrote on TruthSocial.&nbsp;During the pause period, the US will implement a reduced reciprocal tariff of 10 per cent, he added.&nbsp;Defending his approach, Trump portrayed the pause as an example of adaptability in leadership. &ldquo;You have to have flexibility.

Its lawsuit alleged that the three &ldquo;co-orchestrated and executed a lawless scheme&rdquo; to conceal and steal $533 million of loan proceeds (the Alpha Funds). Byju&rsquo;s Alpha is debtor and plaintiff in the lawsuit. &lsquo;Business Standard&rsquo; has asked Byju Raveendran for a comment.&nbsp;The lawsuit follows a $533 million judgment of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware against Riju Ravindran, younger brother of Byju, and the edtech firm&rsquo;s ultimate corporate parent in India.&nbsp;&ldquo;On the heels of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court&rsquo;s recent judgment against his brother (Riju) and companies, this action is being brought to now hold Byju Raveendran, the former CEO [chief executive officer] of Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, and two more of his co-conspirators &ndash; namely his co-founder and close business associate &ndash; accountable for their roles in masterminding the theft of more than half a billion dollars,&rdquo; said the lenders of Byju&rsquo;s Alpha&rsquo;s term loans in the lawsuit.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is clear that Byju, Divya, and Anita deliberately hid the assets of Byju&rsquo;&rsquo;s Alpha and repeatedly were deceptive about the location of the money in order to steal funds rightfully owed to the Lenders. In light of the court&rsquo;s recent decision, there can be no doubt that they acted unlawfully and tried to cover their tracks, breaching fiduciary duties and making numerous misrepresentations, among other misconduct, in the process. If it is not abundantly clear to them by now, Byju and his cohorts will soon learn that the laws of the United States are immutable, and they can either choose to live the rest of their days as international fugitives or face the music and return the money they stole,&rdquo; alleged the lenders.&nbsp;Byju&rsquo;s Alpha is seeking an award of damages for Byju&rsquo;s alleged breach of fiduciary duties, as well as an award of damages for the actions of Byju, Divya, and Anita in aiding and abetting the breach of others&rsquo; fiduciary duties. It also seeks an accounting of the Alpha Funds and an award of damages for conversion and civil conspiracy. Additionally, Byju&#39;s Alpha is requesting reimbursement of all attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs, and expenses, reimbursement of interest expenses, and any other relief that the Court may deem just, proper, or equitable.&nbsp;Starting March 2022, months after receiving term loans, Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, which was then under the control of the Byju&rsquo;s enterprise, defaulted on the credit agreement, according to the lawsuit. In April, the lenders said Byju&rsquo;s began the first in what was a series of systematic and unlawful fraudulent transfers of the Alpha Funds. Byju and his Riju personally conceded defaults had occurred by entering into numerous amendments and forbearances to the credit agreement.&nbsp;In mid-2022 Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, acting at the behest of Byju, Divya and Riju, started transferring $533 million of Alpha Funds to Camshaft Capital Fund, LP (the Camshaft Fund). The lenders alleged it was a sham hedge fund with no investment track record and a listed headquarters with the same address as a pancake restaurant, ostensibly in exchange for receiving a limited partnership interest in the Camshaft Fund.&lsquo;Missing $533 million&rsquo;The lenders alleged that Byju Raveendran, wife Gokulnath and Kishore repeatedly misrepresented and contradicted themselves regarding the use and location of the $533 million Alpha Funds.&nbsp;Following discovery by Timothy R Pohl, a restructuring professional who replaced Riju as sole director of Byju&rsquo;s Alpha, of the transfers of the Alpha Funds to Camshaft, on September 13, 2023, the lenders said that edtech firm Byju&#39;s released a statement in which it &ldquo;categorically denie[d] media reports which insinuated that Byju&#39;s was no longer a beneficiary owner of the funds,&rdquo; instead representing that &ldquo;an offshore subsidiary remains the beneficiary of the money invested in high security fixed income instruments invested with a multi-hundred billion dollar fund in the U.S.&rdquo; Camshaft, however, was not a &ldquo;multi-hundred billion dollar fund,&rdquo; and no &ldquo;high security fixed income instruments&rdquo; were received on account of the Alpha Funds.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is impossible to square Byju&#39;s representations with his repeated statements to the Court, investors, the public, and the lenders over the prior two years. Either Byju has consistently lied about the whereabouts of the Alpha Funds, or he violated a Court Order. It cannot be both,&rdquo; said the lenders.&nbsp;Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as legal counsel for Glas Trust Company, LLC, the administrative agent for the Lenders.

He is likely to land in Delhi and may be placed in a high-security unit at Tihar Jail, according to news reports.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rana, 64, a Canadian national originally from Pakistan, is known to be a close associate of David Coleman Headley, also known as Daood Gilani &mdash; a key conspirator in the Mumbai attacks and a US national.Who is Tahawwur Rana and what was his role in 26/11 attacksTahawwur Rana, born in 1961, in Chichawatni, Pakistan, is a former Pakistan Army Medical Corps captain who later turned to business, running an immigration services company. He is known for his links to the Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and for his association with David Coleman Headley, one of the key planners of the assault.&nbsp;Investigating agencies say Rana was instrumental in enabling Headley&rsquo;s missions in India. He reportedly helped Headley secure an Indian visa and set up a front office in Mumbai disguised as an immigration consultancy, which was used for surveillance of intended targets. These included high-profile locations such as Chabad Houses and the National Defence College. Rana was allegedly aware of Headley&#39;s terror affiliations and supported his operations.&nbsp;In October 2009, the FBI arrested Rana in Chicago for providing support to terror activities. In 2011, a US court convicted him in connection with a planned attack in Denmark but cleared him of charges related to the Mumbai attacks due to jurisdictional issues. India requested his extradition in 2020. Despite citing medical issues, his legal appeals were dismissed, and the US Supreme Court rejected his final plea recently. He now faces trial under Indian anti-terror laws.26/11 Mumbai attacks&nbsp;The 26/11 Mumbai attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist strikes that unfolded over nearly three days, from November 26 to 29, 2008. Ten LeT operatives of the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) carried out the attacks at multiple high-profile locations across Mumbai. Targets included the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), and Nariman House. The attackers were heavily armed with assault rifles, grenades, and explosives, launching indiscriminate shootings and bombings that left 175 people dead &mdash; including nine of the attackers &mdash; and injured more than 300 others.

And they said it could cut its rate if growth slowed and unemployment rose. The minutes were for the Fed&#39;s March 18-19 meeting.But if both happened at the same time, the Fed may face difficult tradeoffs, some of the 19 officials on the central bank&#39;s interest-rate setting committee said. Rising unemployment can often lead to a recession, when the Fed would normally slash its key rate to support more borrowing and spending and stimulate the economy.Yet Fed officials would likely be reluctant to cut if inflation rose, because it usually seeks to cool higher prices by keeping its key rate unchanged or even raising it if necessary.The minutes reflect discussions among Fed officials before President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2 on nearly 60 countries, along with a 10 per cent tariff on nearly all nations. Trump said Wednesday that he had paused the tariffs for 90 days, though the 10 per cent duty would remain, as well as a huge 125 per cent tax on imports from China.The minutes also said that the tariffs that had been announced prior to the March meeting on steel, aluminum, and on many imports from Canada and Mexico had already caused many companies to delay hiring and raise prices.Several Fed officials, according to the minutes, said that their business contacts were already reporting increases in costs, possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs, or had indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases.Many of those same business contacts reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty, the minutes said.In remarks last Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the April 2 tariffs would likely raise inflation and slow growth. He also noted that their impact would likely be temporary, but said there was a heightened chance that they could persistently raise inflation.Inflation has come down sharply from its peak in June 2022, but it has remained stubbornly elevated even before the imposition of duties. Consumer prices were 2.8 per cent higher in February compared to a year ago, though March figures will be released early Thursday and are expected to show inflation declining to 2.6 per cent.", "keywords": ["US Federal Reserve", "Fed interest rates", "Fed rates cut", "Federal Open Market Committee", "Fed policymakers", "US economy"], "date": "2025-04-10T07:22:47+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000044", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:15:45"},

Australia&#39;s S&P/ASX 200 soared 5.1 per cent to 7,748.00. South Korea&#39;s Kospi gained 5.2 per cent to 2,412.80. Hong Kong and Shanghai markets were set to open soon. The Hang Seng index has fallen considerably in the last five days, and could be set for a rebound like the other regional indexes.Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, called the reaction from fear to euphoria.It&#39;s now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia&#39;s exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief, he said, referring to the tariffs on China, which Trump has kept.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 surged 9.5 per cent, an amount that would count as a good year for the market. It had been sinking earlier in the day on worries that Trump&#39;s trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.I have authorised a 90 day PAUSE, Trump said, after recognising the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and had not retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told reporters that Trump was pausing his so-called reciprocal tariffs on most of the country&#39;s biggest trading partners, but maintaining his 10 per cent tariff on nearly all global imports.China was a huge exception, though, with Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125 per cent against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war is not over, and an escalating battle between the world&#39;s two largest economies can create plenty of damage. US stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called Liberation Day.But on Wednesday, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of 2,962 points, or 7.9 per cent. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2 per cent. The S&P 500 had its third-best day since 1940.The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Trump cared about the financial pain the US stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, the index that sits at the centre of many 401(k) accounts, came into the day nearly 19 per cent below its record set less than two months ago.That surprised many professional investors who had long thought that a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.Wednesday&#39;s rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what&#39;s called a bear market. That&#39;s what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10 per cent for US stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20 per cent. The index is now down 11.2 per cent from its record.Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of US Treasurys in the bond market Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had rattled the market, indicating increasing levels of stress. Trump himself said Wednesday that he had been watching the bond market getting a little queasy.Analysts say several reasons could be behind the rise in yields, including hedge funds and other investors having to sell their Treasury bonds to raise cash in order to make up for losses in the stock market. Investors outside the United States may also be selling their US Treasurys because of the trade war. Such actions would push down prices for Treasurys, which in turn would push up their yields.Regardless of the reasons behind it, higher yields on Treasurys add pressure on the stock market and push upward on rates for mortgages and other loans for US households and businesses.The moves are particularly notable because US Treasury yields have historically dropped not risen during scary times for the market because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments. This week&#39;s sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February.After approaching 4.50 per cent in the morning, the 10-year yield pulled back to 4.34 per cent following Trump&#39;s pause and the Treasury&#39;s auction. That&#39;s still up from 4.26 per cent late Tuesday and from just 4.01 per cent at the end of last week.Of course, the trade war is not over. Bessent and Trump clearly showed their anger at China, which has been ratcheting up its own tariffs on US goods and announcing other countermeasures with each move Trump has made.", "keywords": ["ChinaUnited States economic relations", "Economic history of the People's Republic of China", "Economic history of the United States", "Second presidency of Donald Trump", "Customs duties", "Tariffs in the second Trump administration", "Scott Bessent", "Stock market", "Donald Trump", "The Trump Organization", "Dow Jones Industrial Average", "Recession", "Tokyo", "managing partner", "KOREA SE KOSPI INDEX", "Asia", "Shanghai", "social media", "Japan", "President", "HANG SENG INDEX", "United States", "Australia", "SPI Asset Management", "S&P/ASX 200", "China", "NIKKEI 225 INDEX", "Stephen Innes", "Secretary", "South Korea", "S&P 500 INDEX - CBOE", "US Treasury", "DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE INDEX", "PAUSE", "Liberation Day", "NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX"], "date": "2025-04-10T07:09:56+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000100", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:15:45"},

Describing the move as a &ldquo;historic milestone&rdquo;, Trump positioned the tariffs as a measure to reinforce US economic sovereignty. However, economists warn the move could drive up prices for everyday goods such as coffee and chocolate, placing a greater financial strain on consumers.&nbsp;The new tariffs have also raised concerns about their compliance with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. To understand the implications, it is worth examining the history of global trade agreements, particularly the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which laid the foundation for today&rsquo;s system.&nbsp;How have US tariffs evolved over time?&nbsp; Before the 1930s, tariffs were a primary revenue source for the US government. However, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 sharply increased tariff rates, reducing global trade and deepening the Great Depression.&nbsp;In response, the Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934 empowered the executive branch to negotiate bilateral tariff reductions, marking a shift towards trade liberalisation.&nbsp;How did GATT shape global trade rules?&nbsp; Following World War II, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 to lower tariffs and facilitate global economic recovery. Created by 23 countries, one of its core principles was the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) rule, ensuring that any tariff reduction granted to one member had to be extended to all.&nbsp;GATT oversaw several rounds of multilateral negotiations, such as the Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds, which helped significantly reduce global tariffs. The Uruguay Round, concluded in 1994, achieved an average global tariff reduction of 39 per cent.&nbsp;However, GATT lacked strong enforcement mechanisms and did not adequately address non-tariff barriers or trade in services. To strengthen trade governance, the WTO replaced GATT in 1995, introducing binding rules and a formal dispute settlement system.&nbsp;What are the WTO tariff commitments?&nbsp; Under WTO guidelines, member nations commit to &ldquo;tariff bindings&rdquo;, which set maximum tariff levels that cannot be exceeded unless renegotiated. For the US, the average bound tariff for all goods is 3.4 per cent. These commitments, outlined in each country&rsquo;s Schedule of Concessions, ensure stability and predictability in trade.&nbsp;While countries may impose lower &ldquo;applied tariffs&rdquo;, they cannot raise them above the bound levels without violating WTO rules.&nbsp;What are the consequences of exceeding WTO tariff limits?&nbsp; If a country imposes tariffs beyond its agreed limit, it breaches Article II of GATT 1994. Affected members can file complaints through the WTO&rsquo;s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB).&nbsp;The process begins with bilateral consultations. If unresolved, the complainant can request WTO authorisation to impose countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs.&nbsp;What exemptions apply under WTO rules?&nbsp; The WTO grants developing countries Special and Differential Treatment (SDT), allowing them longer transition periods for implementing trade commitments. This gives them flexibility to gradually reduce tariffs and reform subsidies.&nbsp;India benefits from SDT provisions, enabling it to protect key domestic sectors while progressively opening its markets to global competition.&nbsp;Can countries increase tariff rates at will?&nbsp; According to WTO rules, countries can raise bound tariffs only if they negotiate compensation with affected partners. Alternatively, they may invoke emergency provisions&mdash;such as safeguard measures or national security exceptions.&nbsp;In the past, the Trump administration cited national security under Section 232 of the US Trade Act to impose additional tariffs&mdash;25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium. The WTO later ruled these measures violated trade rules, stating that national security clauses must not be applied arbitrarily.&nbsp;Despite the ruling, the US refused to reverse the tariffs, asserting national security as a sovereign matter. Washington has also blocked appointments to the WTO&rsquo;s Appellate Body, effectively paralysing the appeals process.&nbsp;In response, India and several other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs on 28 US products.&nbsp;Why do countries like India have higher tariffs than the US?&nbsp; Developing countries, including India, maintain higher tariffs to support domestic industries, generate revenue, and manage trade imbalances. Protective tariffs help shield nascent sectors from foreign competition and promote economic development.&nbsp;Advanced economies like the US typically apply lower tariffs, as their industries are globally competitive. Open trade policies offer these nations broader market access with minimal restrictions.&nbsp;What next for Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;Liberation Day&rsquo; tariffs?&nbsp; As Trump&rsquo;s reciprocal tariffs come into effect, they are likely to invite WTO challenges from affected trading partners. Whether or not countries pursue formal action, the move is expected to intensify ongoing tensions over WTO reform and the US position on global trade governance.", "keywords": ["Trump tariffs", "WTO rules", "GATT explained", "tariff bindings", "US reciprocal tariffs", "WTO dispute settlement", "India tariffs", "trade war", "global trade norms"], "date": "2025-04-03T19:32:41+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040301244", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:15:49"},

Currently, OPT allows international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students to stay for up to three years after graduation to work in the US. With over 300,000 Indian students studying in the US, many are now in a state of panic as they fear they could be forced to leave immediately after graduation unless they transition to an H-1B visa.&nbsp;What is this Bill about?The bill in question is aimed at ending the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which currently allows international students, particularly those in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, to stay in the United States for up to three years after graduation to work. The OPT program gives these students the opportunity to gain practical experience in their field of study, which helps them build their resumes and repay student loans.&nbsp;The bill, introduced amid rising anti-immigrant sentiments and policies by the US administration, threatens the future of many students who rely on OPT to gain work experience, earn salaries to repay student loans, and establish themselves in the competitive US job market. Indian students are particularly affected as they make up a large portion of the international student body benefiting from OPT. The bill could force them to look for job opportunities outside the US if they are unable to secure an H-1B visa, which has its own challenges due to the lottery system.&nbsp;Why is it worrying Indian students?&nbsp;Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The bill is part of a larger trend of anti-immigrant measures that have been pursued by the Trump administration. These measures include mass deportations and other actions aimed at limiting immigration to the U.S. Trump had campaigned on a platform focused on tightening immigration policies, and his administration had already taken steps during his first term to address this, including limiting work visas and focusing on enforcement.&nbsp;Impact on Students: The introduction of this bill, although previous attempts to end OPT have failed, has triggered panic among F-1 and M-1 visa holders&mdash;students who are studying in the U.S. on these types of visas. The fear among these students, particularly from India, is that without OPT, they will lose the opportunity to work in the US after graduation.&nbsp;Rush to Apply for H-1B Visas: The panic has led many of these students to scramble to find jobs that can transition them to the H-1B visa (a temporary work visa). The H-1B visa is a key route for foreign students who want to continue working in the U.S. after graduation. However, securing an H-1B visa is highly competitive due to the lottery system and strict quotas. Therefore, many students are desperately trying to secure job offers that would enable them to apply for this visa before the potential changes take effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen if the Bill is passed?If the bill passes, Indian students would be forced to leave the US immediately after completing their studies unless they transition to an H-1B visa, which is a temporary work visa. However, the H-1B visa system is highly competitive and subject to a lottery system, meaning that many students may not be able to secure one.&nbsp;This explains the panic among international students who rely on OPT for work opportunities in the US, particularly given the financial burden many carry from student loans. It also affects their future job prospects in the U.S., forcing them to consider studying and working in other countries like Canada or European nations, where post-graduation work opportunities are more stable and accessible.&nbsp;History of Stricter Visa PoliciesDuring Trump&rsquo;s previous presidency there was:&nbsp;Higher visa rejection rates, especially for students from developing countries or Muslim majority countries.More scrutiny of visa applications, including additional interviews and background checks.Policies targeting countries with strained relations with U.S. like Uzbekistan, Ukraine and China.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) played a significant role in implementing these stricter visa policies, citing national security concerns.&nbsp;Many students are worried about their ability to renew or maintain their visas under Trump&rsquo;s second term.&nbsp;In Trump&rsquo;s first term, international students faced:Immigration Policy Uncertainty: Travel ban and proposed OPT restrictions caused anxiety among students and families.Enrollment Decline: Between 2016 and 2018, new international student enrollment declined by 3%, 7% and 1% with some institutions like Illinois Institute of Technology seeing a 25% decline in international enrollment.&ldquo;America First&rdquo; Rhetoric: Trump&rsquo;s focus on American workers worried international graduates about their career prospects.The impact was not limited to campuses but extended to the broader economy as international students bring in billions in tuition and fees and are key to innovation-driven sectors.&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s second term will bring challenges for F-1 visa students and others. Here are some of the potential changes to watch out for, according to Herman Legal Group, LLC&nbsp;More Focus on SecurityExperts say immigration policies under a second Trump administration will be more security-focused. Student mobility will be seen as a security threat rather than an opportunity to develop the world or grow the economy.&nbsp;Changes to OPT and STEM OPT ExtensionsCurrent SituationOPT allows international students to work in the U.S. for one year after college graduation, with STEM students eligible for a two-year extension. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld STEM OPT extension in October 2023 and gave relief to students and universities.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s Likely Changing?Trump&rsquo;s previous administration tried to:&nbsp;Limit OPT durationEliminate or restrict STEM OPT, citing competition for American workers.With Trump back in office, these policies will be revisited under his &ldquo;Buy American, Hire American&rdquo; agenda:&nbsp;Restricting OPT will:&nbsp;Disrupt individual career paths by limiting opportunities for graduating students who depend on work experienceUndermine the U.S. as a global technology leader.&nbsp;Challenges with F-1 Visa Renewal and Student Visa RulesWith increased administrative processing, scrutiny and background checks, students who need to extend their F-1 visa will be uncertain. F-1 students who are in the U.S. but whose prior F-1 visa has expired will need to re-apply for the F-1 visa in their home country if they want to travel outside the U.S. and re-enter on F-1 status.&nbsp;Funding for Professional ProgramsTrump&rsquo;s threat to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and his restrictionist policies on international student and scholar programs have many internationals worried about funding programs that support their studies and work in the U.S.&nbsp;What&#39;s the other fallout of this policy?&nbsp;No Alternative Transition:&nbsp;Currently, students on OPT have the opportunity to apply for an H-1B visa (a temporary work visa for highly skilled workers) to continue working in the U.S. However, if OPT is eliminated, students may lose this transition path.&nbsp;Students who are unable to secure an H-1B visa or do not have a qualified employer to sponsor them would have to leave the U.S. immediately, significantly affecting their professional prospects.&nbsp;Non-STEM Graduates Are Already Affected:&nbsp;As it stands, non-STEM graduates are already required to leave the U.S. one year after completing their degree, since they do not qualify for the STEM extension of OPT.&nbsp;The bill would exacerbate this issue for STEM students as well, removing their ability to stay and work in the U.S. without an alternative work visa.

The extradition marks a significant step in India&#39;s pursuit of justice for one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in its history.&nbsp;Who is Tahawwur Rana?Born on January 12, 1961, in Chichawatni, Pakistan, Rana served as a captain in the Pakistan Army Medical Corps before transitioning into business. He operated an immigration services firm and maintained ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group responsible for orchestrating the 26/11 attacks. Rana is also known for his association with David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American terrorist and one of the key conspirators of the Mumbai attacks.&nbsp;Role in the 26/11 attacksAccording to investigative agencies, Rana played a crucial role in facilitating Headley&rsquo;s reconnaissance missions in India. He helped Headley obtain a visa to India and set up a front office in Mumbai under the guise of an immigration consultancy. This office served as a cover for Headley&rsquo;s surveillance activities targeting locations later attacked by LeT operatives. Rana was aware of Headley&rsquo;s terror affiliations and actively supported him in planning attacks on high-profile targets, including Chabad Houses and the National Defence College.&nbsp;2008 Mumbai attacksThe 26/11 Mumbai attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist strikes carried out by ten LeT operatives across Mumbai from November 26 to November 29, 2008. The attackers targeted prominent locations such as the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), and Nariman House. Armed with AK-47 rifles, grenades, and explosives, they unleashed mass shootings and bombings that resulted in the deaths of 175 people (including nine attackers) and injuries to over 300 individuals. The siege lasted nearly 60 hours and drew global condemnation.&nbsp;Arrest of Tahawwur Rana&nbsp;Rana was arrested by the FBI in Chicago in October 2009 on charges of providing material support to terrorism. While he was convicted in 2011 for aiding LeT&rsquo;s planned attack on the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, he was acquitted of charges directly related to the Mumbai attacks by a US court due to jurisdictional limitations. However, India filed an extradition request in 2020, citing his involvement in planning the attacks.After years of legal battles, including appeals citing health concerns such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and abdominal ailments, Rana&rsquo;s attempts to block extradition were denied by US courts. The Supreme Court rejected his final petition earlier this week.&nbsp;Charges against Tahawwur RanaRana face charges under Indian laws for conspiracy to commit terrorism and providing material support to LeT. Upon his arrival in India, he is expected to be presented before a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court for custodial interrogation.

This kind of cooperation could offer near-term benefits and deserves attention at both government and industry levels,&quot; Srivastava said.He added that India could propose a limited &quot;zero-to-zero&quot; tariff deal with the US on 90 per cent of industrial goods excluding sensitive items like cars.&quot;If accepted by the US, this could evolve into a WTO (World Trade Organization)-compliant goods-only agreement. Stop offering unilateral concessions to the US,&quot; he said, adding India should prioritise free trade negotiations with the European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada, and consider broader partnerships with countries like China and Russia.The government should also tackle domestic reforms such as simplifying tariffs, hassle-free and just implementation of quality control orders, improving GST processes, and streamlining trade procedures.&quot;These changes are critical if India wants to make the most of global shifts, though progress may be slow,&quot; he said.", "keywords": ["Georgia Tech Research Institute", "Free trade agreements of the European Union", "Trade blocs", "Presidency of Barack Obama", "Australia", "manufacturing output", "food security", "machinery", "Washington", "World Trade Organization", "electronics", "food imports", "United Kingdom", "China", "pharmaceuticals", "European Union", "tackle", "e-commerce giants", "farmer", "Russia", "United States", "India", "Ajay Srivastava", "chemicals", "car industry", "Europe", "Canada"], "date": "2025-04-10T10:20:43+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000221", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:16:06"},

At around 2.30 pm, the airline claimed the top global spot with a market capitalisation of $23.24 billion &mdash; nudging past Delta&rsquo;s $23.18 billion. The lead was short-lived and by market close IndiGo&rsquo;s valuation slipped to $23.16 billion, just a notch below Delta&rsquo;s, the data showed. IndiGo is the world&rsquo;s second most valuable airline by market capitalisation.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a notable achievement for an airline that started commercial operations only in August 2006. Delta has been flying since 1929.&nbsp;Just six years ago, Delta&rsquo;s market value was $36.67 billion, while IndiGo&rsquo;s was $7.72 billion.&nbsp;IndiGo operates 15,768 flights per week &mdash; up 12.7 per cent compared to April last year, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.&nbsp;Delta operates 35,144 flights weekly, 6.6 per cent higher than the corresponding month last year.&nbsp;As of the end of 2024, IndiGo had a fleet of 437 aircraft.

The people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.The question is, Was Trump already contemplating the tariff pause when he made that post?&nbsp;Asked about when he arrived at his decision, Trump gave a muddled answer.I would say this morning,&quot; he said. Over the last few days, I&#39;ve been thinking about it.He then added, Fairly early this morning.Asked for clarification on the timing in an email to the White House later, a spokesperson didn&#39;t answer directly but defended Trump&#39;s post as part of his job.It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,&quot; wrote White House spokesman Kush Desai.Another curiosity of the posting was Trump&#39;s signoff with his initials.DJT is also the stock symbol for Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of the president&#39;s social media platform Truth Social.It&#39;s not clear if Trump was saying buying stocks in general, or Trump Media in particular.

That was followed by a Fox TV appearance by his commerce secretary urging viewers to buy the stock.Tesla&#39;s surge Wednesday added $20 billion to Musk&#39;s fortunes.Kathleen Clark, a government ethics law expert at Washington University School of Law, says Trump&#39;s post in other administrations would have been investigated, but is not likely not to trigger any reaction, save for maybe more Truth Social viewers.He&#39;s sending the message that he can effectively and with impunity manipulate the market, she said, As in: Watch this space for future stock tips.", "keywords": ["Donald trump", "Tariffs", "Mexico", "Canada", "US trade relations", "Claudia Sheinbaum"], "date": "2025-04-10T07:06:25+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000081", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:16:40"},

In Q4FY25, Chetak emerged as the highest-selling model in its segment with a 29 per cent share of the market, both in terms of volume and value, the Pune-based company claimed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bajaj Chetak has secured the No.1 position by volume and value in the Indian electric vehicle two-wheeler segment for the last quarter of FY25 with a 29 per cent market share,&rdquo; the company said.&nbsp;The Chetak was originally introduced in the 1970s, when it had a strong presence in the Indian scooter market for several decades. Bajaj Auto said that the strong sales performance is a result of an extensive retail and service network of 3,800 outlets, as well as the two newly launched models &mdash; the 29 series and 35 series &mdash; which together contributed over two lakh unit sales in 2024.&nbsp;As for FY25, Ola Electric had a retail market share of 29.93 per cent, followed by TVS at 20.67 per cent, and Bajaj close on its heels at 20.08 per cent, according to Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) data. Ola Electric is in the middle of a controversy wherein the company has been accused of including preliminary bookings as registrations.&nbsp;Bajaj launched the 35 series of the Chetak, priced between Rs 1.2 lakh and Rs 1.27 lakh (ex-showroom in Bangalore), in December. It is positioned as the premium variant. The company has said that more platforms and variants of the Chetak are in the offing. The year 2025 may see another couple of platforms for the Chetak.&nbsp;Maharashtra accounted for a major portion of Chetak&rsquo;s success, where the scooter held a 50 per cent market share during Q4FY25.&nbsp;Around 40 per cent of Bajaj&rsquo;s domestic revenue now comes from vehicles running on cleaner fuels such as electricity and compressed natural gas (CNG). The company has CNG-powered three-wheelers.&nbsp;Eric Vas, president of the Urbanite Business Unit at Bajaj Auto, said, &ldquo;We are happy to reach this coveted milestone. Chetak has once again become a customer favourite &mdash; from ICE to its electric avatar.&rdquo;&nbsp;He added, &ldquo;Bajaj Auto has led the EV revolution with its offerings in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler space. This is a result of our curated strategy of differentiated offerings, focus on customer experience, and service network.

He recorded an episode for Kamath&rsquo;s podcast, &quot;WTF,&quot; at a five-star hotel equipped with an air purifier. Despite wearing an N95 mask, he exited the podcast midway, saying the indoor air quality index (AQI) was around 120.&nbsp;At one point, when asked about India&#39;s air pollution, he remarked, &quot;I can&#39;t see you over there.&quot;&nbsp;Bryan Johnson: Air pollution in India is &lsquo;normalised&rsquo;Confirming the incident on X, Johnson explained that the room circulated outdoor air, rendering his portable air purifier ineffective. By the time he left, the indoor AQI had climbed to 130, with PM2.5 levels at 75 micrograms per cubic metre, he said.&nbsp;Johnson explained that this was &quot;equivalent to smoking 3.4 cigarettes over 24 hours.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;This was my third day in India, and the air pollution had already caused my skin to break out in a rash and my eyes and throat to burn,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;Johnson criticised how air pollution has become &quot;deeply normalised&quot; in India. &quot;People were outside running, babies and small children were exposed from birth, and no one wore a mask, which can significantly reduce exposure.

The decision, made after reviewing the groom&rsquo;s credit report, reflects the importance families place on financial stability over more traditional factors such as family background and personal compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cibil score: The new matrimonial criteriaAccording to a report by The Times of India, the wedding arrangements between the two families had been nearly finalised, with preparations well underway. However, during a customary pre-wedding meeting, the bride&rsquo;s uncle made an unexpected request: to review the groom&rsquo;s Cibil report, a document summarising an individual&rsquo;s credit history, outstanding loans, and repayment behaviour.&nbsp;Upon accessing the report, the bride&rsquo;s relatives were shocked to learn that the groom had multiple loans from various financial institutions, resulting in a poor credit rating. A low Cibil score generally indicates defaults, delayed payments, and financial instability, raising concerns about the groom&rsquo;s ability to provide financial security in the marriage.&nbsp;The bride&rsquo;s uncle questioned whether someone already burdened with significant debt could ensure a stable financial future for his spouse. His apprehensions quickly gained support from other family members, who felt that the financial risks were too high. After a discussion, they unanimously decided to call off the engagement.&nbsp;This incident highlights how financial awareness is increasingly influencing personal and social decisions beyond just banking and lending.&nbsp;As financial literacy improves, factors like creditworthiness are likely to become essential considerations in marriages, particularly in arranged setups where families seek long-term stability.&nbsp;What is a Cibil score?A Cibil score is a three-digit number (ranging from 300 to 900) that reflects your credit history, derived from your Cibil report. This report includes details about your loans, credit card accounts, payment history, and outstanding balances. A higher score (750 and above) signals responsible financial behaviour, while a low score suggests poor debt management and higher financial risks.&nbsp;A score between 750 and 900 is considered excellent.&nbsp;Financial institutions use this score to assess loan eligibility, influencing everything from interest rates to borrowing limits. A poor credit score can lead to loan rejections or stringent repayment conditions.&nbsp;A Cibil score can be maintained or improved by:&nbsp;Timely payments: Ensure all loan EMIs and credit card bills are paid before the due date.&nbsp;Low credit utilisation: Keep credit card usage below 30% of the limit to avoid appearing over-reliant on credit.&nbsp;Limit multiple loan applications: Frequent credit inquiries can negatively impact the score.&nbsp;Diverse credit mix: A combination of secured (home, car loans) and unsecured (credit cards, personal loans) credit can help improve the score.", "keywords": ["bride calls off wedding Cibil score", "groom low Cibil score marriage", "Cibil score in arranged marriages", "credit score impact on marriage", "financial stability in matrimony", "Cibil score marriage criteria", "poor credit rating marriage India", "financial literacy arranged marriages", "credit report marriage decisions", "Cibil score importance relationships", "financial risks in marriage", "creditworthiness in matrimony", "family cancels wedding over debt", "Cibil report marriage compatibility", "credit score influence Indian weddings"], "date": "2025-02-08T17:32:49+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125020801108", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:19:14"},

The incident happened when an Ertiga approached from behind the pedestrians, according to a Reddit post that went viral.&nbsp;Before stopping a little way ahead, the driver purposefully hit one of them with the side mirror of the vehicle. The pedestrians walked up to the car, assuming the driver had stopped to apologize.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they encountered aggression and verbal abuse in place of an apology. The person threatened them and demanded money for &ldquo;damages&rdquo;.

Just wanted to alert all of you to be careful while you&rsquo;re walking on the roads.

(@DanielleFong) April 6, 2025Trump&rsquo;s tariffs policyOn April 2, Trump announced a sweeping reciprocal tariffs policy aimed at addressing the United States&rsquo; trade deficit. These tariffs, described as a &ldquo;declaration of economic independence&rdquo;, include a universal baseline tariff of 10 per cent on all imports starting April 5, alongside country-specific duties that will take effect on April 9. The reciprocal tariffs are calculated based on the trade barriers imposed by other nations, including monetary and non-monetary factors such as subsidies, currency manipulation, and intellectual property theft.&nbsp;Trump imposed a flat 26 per cent tariff on all Indian exports. This rate was calculated based on India&rsquo;s cumulative trade barriers, which Trump claimed amounted to a 52 per cent tariff on US goods. Trump framed these tariffs as a move toward revitalising domestic manufacturing and reducing the national debt through increased customs revenue.&nbsp;However, the announcement triggered immediate global backlash, with countries like Canada and China imposing retaliatory tariffs. Economists warn that these measures could lead to a recession in the US, while also straining relations with major trading partners like India.", "keywords": ["Orange Monday", "stock market crash", "Trump tariffs", "global stock selloff", "US stock futures plunge", "Black Monday 2025", "Jim Cramer 1987 crash warning", "Dow Jones fall", "Asian markets drop", "Alibaba stock fall", "Tencent shares drop", "Nikkei index fall", "Orange is the New Black Monday", "Trump trade policy", "orange monday meaning", "orange monday memes", "black monday", "black monday stock market", "black monday market crash", "stock market monday", "stock market crash"], "date": "2025-04-07T12:32:57+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040700372", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:19:44"},

Similarly, an NBFC can do colending with another NBFC.&nbsp;This move is expected to enhance the flow of credit to underserved segments, such as micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and ensure stronger customer protection, experts said.&nbsp;However, experts highlighted the process of forming partnerships and executing colending agreements was lengthy, which may be a challenge. Additionally, regulated entities have to share risks of a client defaulting on payment, therefore posing an additional burden on banks and NBFCs.&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;co-lending arrangements have helped in PSL. Now, we are expanding to other segments outside PSL as well. Currently, it was the bank and the NBFCs who could enter into this arrangement. Now, two banks can enter into this arrangement as well,&rdquo; said RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, adding that under this arrangement, the borrower got the benefit of lower interest rates as banks received funds at lower rates and NBFCs compensated for the rest. So, it is a win-win for banks and NBFCs, he said.&nbsp;Kirti Timmanagoudar, head of strategy & co-lending, IIFL Finance, said: &ldquo;Small NBFCs that were not able to come into a pact with banks can now easily do so, starting with a large NBFC as step 1 and then with banks. In a nutshell, it is a positive move and will help underserved customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;Colending allows regulated entities to jointly fund a loan portfolio in a ratio agreed upon, involving revenue and risk sharing with or without sourcing and management arrangements.&nbsp;According to the RBI&rsquo;s revised guidelines on colending, if any regulated entity declares a client a non-performing asset, it will be classified accordingly for all other regulated entities. Additionally, regulated entities involved in colending will be allowed to provide default-loss guarantees up to 5 per cent of loans outstanding in respect of loans under the agreement. Providing such default-loss guarantees will be governed by guidelines issued for digital lending.&nbsp;Experts said NBFCs typically disbursed loans to customers with profiles similar to those in PSL, though they were not classified under PSL. Since NBFCs are not subject to PSL requirements, they do not need to verify customer backgrounds. However, when entering into a colending agreement with a bank, adequate certification is required, which some NBFCs fail to provide. Therefore, the relaxation of the PSL requirement in colending arrangements will help NBFCs increase credit flow to underserved sectors.&nbsp;Earlier a committee, headed by State Bank of India, had been set up by the Department of Financial Services on colending.&nbsp;This model has emerged as a powerful mechanism to enhance financial inclusion and expand credit access.&nbsp;It has been used to serve sectors like MSMEs, electric vehicles, and loans for agriculture.&nbsp;Commercial banks have partnered seven NBFCs for colending, while private banks have had deals with a smaller number of NBFCs, indicating significant untapped potential in this space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Seventy-five per cent of colending volumes handled by banks are in non-PSL loans.

The predictability quotient is high for the June MPC as there is near unanimity among market participants that it is going to keep the policy rates unchanged.&nbsp;An encouraging softening in the core inflation momentum provides the space to observe the lagged effect of past rate hikes in nudging the headline CPI towards the medium-term target of 4 per cent, and also the risks of any unfavorable monsoon outcome. On the other hand, with the 4QFY23 GDP data coming out to be stronger than expected, there is no urgent need for a cyclical&nbsp;monetary policy support to growth. Most high-frequency growth indicators are also not ringing any alarm bells. Despite stronger headline growth, the composition of growth is favouring investment over consumption and hence, turns out to be less inflationary.While there could be marginal tweaks to the RBI&rsquo;s growth/ inflation forecasts and tone in the policy statement, the market focus could be on two tangible areas &mdash;&nbsp; any change in monetary policy stance and any measures on liquidity management. Predicting the point at which the RBI will be comfortable changing the monetary policy stance has become difficult because of different interpretations of the stance even among MPC members. We think that three considerations could tilt the RBI towards holding on to the &ldquo;withdrawal of accommodation&rdquo; stance, but it will be a close call.First, with some uncertainty from El Nino-related inflation risks still persisting and global central bankers not at the end of their rate-hike cycles, keeping the stance unchanged could be a prudent risk-management strategy towards keeping all options open. Second, headline CPI is still higher than the medium-term target of 4 per cent, even on a 12-month forecast horizon. If a change in stance is considered to be &lsquo;too dovish&rsquo; by the markets, then the RBI&rsquo;s efforts to achieve the target might be hampered.&nbsp;The policy stance has become an important communication tool and hence, the indirect impacts of that have to be assessed too. Third, both durable liquidity and banking system liquidity are now higher than where they were during the April policy.&nbsp;The increase in surplus liquidity could particularly be due to large foreign exchange interventions, higher RBI dividend to government and the Rs 2,000 note withdrawal process. A change in policy stance at this juncture might not be in sync with the current liquidity.&nbsp;Some MPC members might feel that with a sharper-than-expected moderation in headline/ core CPI, the real rates have reached a point where a change in stance to &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; is warranted.&nbsp;A change in stance could be inferred by the markets as a definite sign of rates peaking.&nbsp;The MPC needs to be comfortable with expressing that softer than the &lsquo;pause but not a pivot&rsquo; view of the April policy. It could be a surprise dovish signal for the markets, further supporting the current trend in falling yields.The writer is Managing Director, Chief Economist, India Citi Research, Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited", "keywords": ["RBI policy", "mpc", "monetary policy review"], "date": "2023-06-05T22:42:35+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "123060501151", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:21:37"},

Under a unique campaign for home loan borrowers, India&#39;s top lender is offering concessions of up to 65 basis points (bps).&nbsp;The last date for the concession on home loans is 31 December 2023.&nbsp;The concessions are based on the CIBIL score.CIBIL Score is a three-digit numeric summary of your credit history. The score is derived using the credit history found in the CIBIL Report (also known as CIR i.e Credit Information Report). A CIR is an individual&#39;s credit payment history across loan types and credit institutions over a period of time.The CIBIL score works as a first impression for the lender, the higher the score, the better are your chances of the loan being reviewed and approved. The decision to lend is solely dependent on the bank and CIBIL does not in any manner decide if the loan/credit card should be sanctioned or not.Your CIBIL score, calculated based on your credit behaviour as reflected in the &lsquo;Accounts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Enquiries&rsquo; section of your CIR, ranges between 300-900.

Who are anchor investors?", "content": "Vodafone Idea (Vi), India&#39;s third-largest telecom operator, has raised about Rs 5,400 crore in its follow-on public offering from anchor investors including GQG Partners, Fidelity Investments, UBS Fund Management, Jupiter Fund Management, and Australian Super.&nbsp;These are typically big investors who commit to buying a significant portion of the shares offered in the IPO upfront.Who are Anchor Investors?Anchor investors are typically large institutional investors like investment management firms, mutual funds, or sovereign wealth funds. They commit to buying a significant portion of the shares offered in an IPO or FPO upfront, usually before the offering is open to the public.Why are Anchor Investors Important?Boost Confidence: Participation from well-known and reputable anchor investors signals confidence in the company&#39;s future prospects. This can attract other investors who might be hesitant otherwise.&nbsp;Guaranteed Demand: By committing to buy shares upfront, anchor investors provide a certain level of guaranteed demand for the offering. This helps ensure the success of the FPO and raises the necessary capital for Vi.&nbsp;Price Stability: During the initial public offering period, anchor investors can help stabilize the share price by acting as a buffer against short-term fluctuations.Here are some of the potential anchor investors in the FPO:GQG Partners - A global investment management firmFidelity Management & Research Co. - A major American investment companyHDFC Mutual Fund - A leading mutual fund company in IndiaQuant Mutual Fund - Another prominent Indian mutual fund companyFPO vs. IPO:IPO: When a company sells shares to the public for the first time, it&#39;s called an IPO.

This initiative goes beyond mere amendments to tax laws, representing a comprehensive, reimagined framework for tax governance. As a tax professional, I have observed the substantial effects of these reforms on tax authorities and the taxpayer community. The integration of sophisticated technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining how businesses view their compliance data and processes, while also reshaping the roles of tax and finance controllers in India.&nbsp;Integrated approach to tax administrationA noteworthy advancement in India&rsquo;s tax administration is the growing integration between direct and indirect tax administration and other governmental and fiscal institutions. The government has enhanced the tax system&#39;s coherence and efficiency by utilising data from diverse sources. For example, GST reporting in the Tax Audit Report, cross-legislation reconciliations during assessments, and the introduction of the Annual Information Statement (AIS) with comprehensive income tax and GST data have all become the norm. This consolidation has significantly improved compliance rates, contributing to increased tax revenue.&nbsp;The implementation of e-invoicing has expedited the acquisition of transaction-level data, promoting greater precision and uniformity. The adoption of the Invoice Reference Number (IRN) system has set new benchmarks for consistency in tax reporting. Increasing demands for detailed reporting and verification during tax assessments underscore the importance of an integrated tax governance framework.&nbsp;Contemporary challengesIndia&rsquo;s regulatory landscape requires unmatched precision and adaptability. Tax functions also face challenges such as limited budgets and a scarcity of skilled personnel. The EY Tax and Finance Operations (TFO) Survey of 2024 identifies budget constraints as the predominant challenge for tax leaders, closely followed by talent acquisition and retention issues. A decline in the number of new entrants to the accounting profession has further widened this talent gap. Moreover, the evolving skill set for tax professionals now includes expertise in data analytics and AI.&nbsp;To overcome these obstacles, organisations are adopting innovative hybrid models that combine internal expertise with external resources and automation. According to the EY survey, more than half of tax leaders are considering adjustments to their operational models to incorporate these hybrid strategies.&nbsp;GenAI: A pivotal innovation for tax functionsGenerative AI (GenAI) is revolutionising the tax domain with its unique capabilities. Unlike traditional technology solutions that identify patterns and make predictions, GenAI independently generates insights and conducts complex analyses. It excels in navigating intricate tax scenarios, such as evaluating the implications of regulatory changes, drafting compliance reports, reviewing notifications from tax authorities, and extracting actionable intelligence from documents like annual reports.&nbsp;The EY TFO Survey reveals that 87 per cent of tax professionals acknowledge that GenAI enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations, a substantial increase from the previous year&rsquo;s survey. While 75 per cent of tax departments are in the early stages of GenAI adoption, its rapid evolution is expected to transform modern tax practices. Organisations that strategically integrate GenAI will secure a competitive edge in efficiency and innovation.&nbsp;Strategic advantages of integrated tax platforms powered by GenAIThe focus is shifting towards comprehensive technology platforms rather than isolated solutions targeting specific issues. These platforms ensure data integrity and provide a unified source of truth. Such a holistic approach is essential for addressing complex tax reconciliations, as mandated by Clause 44 in the Tax Audit Report, and for cross-utilising 26AS information during GST audits. By combining vast datasets with technological innovation, the tax function is emerging as a strategic contributor to decision-making processes.&nbsp;Much like ERP and CMS solutions, building a transparent and comprehensive organisational tax data model using integrated tax platforms not only reduces individual dependencies but also enhances strategic decision-making. Advanced tools such as GenAI and predictive analytics enable real-time data processing, sophisticated risk management, and informed decision-making.&nbsp;These tools empower CFOs and tax directors to identify tax planning opportunities while ensuring compliance. Integration with ERP systems embeds tax compliance into everyday business activities, improving precision and reducing manual errors. Additionally, some CFOs are leveraging tax technology for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting, aligning tax practices with sustainability goals and navigating environmental tax regulations.&nbsp;Preparing for the futureIn summary, the Indian government&rsquo;s commitment to leveraging technology in tax administration is yielding tangible benefits. The integration of tax types, implementation of electronic invoicing and IRN systems, and the transition to faceless assessments are streamlining and increasing the transparency of the tax system.&nbsp;Organisations must adapt by embracing integrated technology platforms that ensure compliance and provide a comprehensive view of their tax obligations. Looking ahead, it is evident that technology will remain a pivotal force in tax administration. By adopting integrated solutions and advanced technologies such as AI and data analytics, both governmental bodies and corporations can achieve greater efficiency, transparency, and regulatory adherence.&nbsp;To realise these benefits, businesses must innovate by adopting scalable integrated solutions, prioritising a data-centric approach, and enhancing workforce skill sets. Entities that focus on these parameters will be well-prepared to navigate India&rsquo;s intricate tax environment and drive value creation. The shift toward a fully digital tax administration is progressing rapidly, with its advantages becoming increasingly apparent.&nbsp;(Sameer Gupta is National Tax Leader, EY India.&nbsp;Manoj Rathi, Tax Partner, EY India, also contributed to this article.)&nbsp;Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the writer.

Trump reiterated that reciprocal tariffs on nations that impose duties on US goods will come into effect from April 2.&nbsp;This is the second time that Trump spoke about India&rsquo;s trade tariffs. Previously, he referred to India as a &ldquo;tariff king&rdquo;.&nbsp; During his first address to the US Congress earlier this week, he also cited instances of tariff disparities with nations like India, and China, stating, &ldquo;India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 per cent. China&#39;s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them.&rdquo; Criticising India for its high tariffs, he described them as &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.&nbsp;While signing executive orders at the Oval Office, Trump said, currently the tariffs are &lsquo;temporary and small ones&rsquo;, further mentioning that the predominant tariffs will be reciprocal and will come into effect on April 2.&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s stance on reciprocal tariffs&nbsp;Explaining what a high tariff nation is, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s a high tariff nation &ndash; it&rsquo;s Canada. Canada charges us 250 per cent for our milk product and other products, and a tremendous tariff with lumber and things as such. And yet we don&#39;t need their lumber. We have more lumber than they do. We don&rsquo;t need Canada&rsquo;s lumber.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to media reports, Trump justified the reciprocal tariffs by stating, &ldquo;because we&#39;ve been ripped off by every country in the world, and now whatever they charge us, they charge us 150-200 per cent (and) we charge them nothing. So whatever they charge us, we&rsquo;re going to charge them, and there&#39;ll be no getting out of it. So we look forward to April 2. I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to that date for a long time.

It doesn&#39;t mean Beijing doesn&#39;t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.As the world&#39;s second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong.After the US this past week imposed another 10 per cent tariff, on top of the 10 per cent imposed on February 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we&#39;re ready to fight till the end.The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing&#39;s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China.All are designed to inflict pain on the US economy and businesses in response to the American measures.That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump&#39;s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15 per cent, suspending US lumber imports and blacklisting 15 US companies.Beijing showed restraint in its response to leave room for negotiation, analysts say.Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump&#39;s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it&#39;s not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.That&#39;s not a scheduling issue, it&#39;s leverage for China, said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Xi won&#39;t walk into a call if there&#39;s a chance he&#39;ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won&#39;t play the role of a supplicant.Instead, China is hitting back promptly but judiciously to each set of tariffs, Russel said.At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that no country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.Such two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,&quot; Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the US, but noted that if you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are not psychologically shocked by Trump&#39;s shock-and-awe tactics.They&#39;ve seen this before, Kennedy said. These are the kind of things that they&#39;ve anticipated.China&#39;s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5 per cent annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas.It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump&#39;s first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the US.In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the US has fallen.They are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago, Kennedy said.Meanwhile, more than 80 per cent of Mexico&#39;s exports go to the US, and Canada sends 75 per cent of its exports here.China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump&#39;s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods.Beijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn&#39;t work,&quot; Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum &quot;bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.Sheinbaum also has said that no one wins with this decision.", "keywords": ["Second presidency of Donald Trump", "ChinaUnited States economic relations", "Economic history of the People's Republic of China", "Economic history of the United States", "Trade wars", "First Trump tariffs", "ChinaUnited States trade war", "America", "trustee chair", "Prime Minister", "Justin Trudeau", "vice president for international security and diplomacy", "guard", "Asia Society Policy Institute", "President", "United States", "Brazil", "Sun Yun", "Beijing", "Centre for Strategic and International Studies", "Canada", "Stimson Centre", "Scott Kennedy", "Washington", "assistant secretary of state", "Daniel Russel", "Wang Yi", "Foreign Minister", "Communist Party", "China", "Xi Jinping", "Argentina", "Mexico", "Claudia Sheinbaum", "Donald Trump", "Chinese government", "director of the China"], "date": "2025-03-09T12:28:59+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125030900147", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:21:50"},

These measures could allow the administration to slap duties of up to 50 per cent on certain imports.&nbsp;Trump may also revive a national security probe into the auto industry, a move that could trigger tariffs on vehicle imports as soon as April 2, the report said, citing lawyers and sources familiar with the plan. Another, albeit less likely, alternative is Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which permits temporary tariffs of up to 15 per cent for 150 days. The administration has yet to finalise its approach, with the scope and purpose of the tariffs still under discussion.&nbsp;Soon after taking office, Trump vowed to unveil new tariffs on April 2, branding the date &ldquo;liberation day&rdquo;. The pledge set off a wave of diplomatic efforts, with foreign governments lobbying senior US officials for exemptions. He initially imposed a blanket 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium imports, extending duties to a range of products made with the metals. He later announced tariffs on allies, including Mexico and Canada, only to reverse course following intense pressure from businesses.&nbsp;On Monday, Trump reaffirmed his intent to impose &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; tariffs on trading partners, though he signalled that some nations might secure exemptions. &ldquo;They have charged us so much that I am embarrassed to charge them what they have charged us, but it will be substantial,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Hours later, he unveiled a new 25 per cent tariff targeting countries purchasing oil and gas from Venezuela, including India and China. &ldquo;Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the freedoms we espouse,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Truth Social. &ldquo;Any country that buys oil and/or gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a tariff of 25 per cent on any trade they do with our country.&rdquo;&nbsp;A presidential order signed Monday stipulates that the tariff will take effect as early as April 2 and will apply broadly to both direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan crude.Preparing for tariff blitz&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trump officials are exploring legal options to fast-track tariff implementation, according to the FT&nbsp;Key avenues under review:&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 301 investigations&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Emergency Economic Powers Act&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; These measures could enable tariffs of up to 50% on certain imports&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trump may revive national security probe into auto industry&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This could lead to tariffs on vehicle imports as early as April 2&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another option, though less likely, is Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows:&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporary tariffs of up to 15%&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A maximum duration of 150 days&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;", "keywords": ["Donald Trump tariffs", "Trump new tariff regime", "Trump emergency powers tariffs", "Section 301 investigation", "International Emergency Economic Powers Act", "Section 338 Tariff Act", "Section 122 Trade Act 1974", "US tariff strategy", "Trump steel aluminium tariffs", "US import duties", "Trump Venezuela oil tariff", "US trade policy", "Trump trade war", "Trump tariffs", "US tariffs", "April 2 tariffs announcement", "India US trade"], "date": "2025-03-25T19:50:27+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125032501048", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:21:53"},

For non-agricultural goods, the average applied tariff is 13.5 per cent. These rates are significantly higher than those of other large economies and well above the global average.&nbsp;India&rsquo;s World Trade Organisation (WTO) bound tariff rates on agricultural products are also among the highest in the world, averaging 113.1 per cent and ranging as high as 300 per cent.&nbsp;The report states that tariff changes in India are often made without prior notice or stakeholder consultation, creating unpredictability for exporters.&nbsp;For US exporters, India&rsquo;s tariff barriers are compounded by non-tariff measures, such import bans, restrictions, licensing requirements on certain goods, mandatory Quality Control Orders (QCOs), customs barriers, price control on medical devices, and mandatory domestic testing and certification requirements for equipment. The report also flags concerns over burdensome customs valuation practices, arbitrary regulatory changes, and excessive documentation.&nbsp;Agriculture&nbsp;In the agriculture sector, the report describes India&rsquo;s minimum support price (MSP) programme as one of the most production- and trade-distorting forms of agricultural support. The MSP programme covers 25 agricultural products, with rice and wheat being the most prominent.&nbsp;By setting price floors before planting seasons, the MSP distorts planting decisions, leads to overproduction, restricts import demand, and artificially enhances India&rsquo;s export competitiveness.&nbsp;US industry groups have also raised concerns over India&rsquo;s sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) barriers. These include a zero-tolerance policy for certain pests, mandatory methyl bromide fumigation, and slow risk assessment procedures.&nbsp;According to the report, such requirements often lack scientific justification and disproportionately affect US agricultural exports, including almonds, walnuts, grains, and dairy products. Import quotas and licensing restrictions further reduce access to India&rsquo;s food market.&nbsp;Pharmaceutical sector&nbsp;The NTE report also highlights persistent trade barriers in the pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors. India maintains price caps on essential medical devices such as coronary stents and knee implants, affecting US manufacturers&rsquo; profits and product availability.&nbsp;In April 2024, India also banned imports of refurbished medical equipment, including items sent abroad for repair or maintenance under warranty.&nbsp;The report notes that India lacks a patent linkage mechanism that would prevent regulatory approval of generic drugs that may infringe valid patents. US pharmaceutical firms continue to face long delays in patent processing, limited protection of clinical trial data, and enforcement challenges.&nbsp;Digital trade&nbsp;India&rsquo;s digital trade and e-commerce regulations have drawn criticism in the USTR report. While India removed its two per cent digital services tax in August 2024 after bilateral negotiations, the report states that a six per cent equalisation levy on online advertising and digital services provided by non-resident firms remains in place.&nbsp;This levy increases operational costs for US digital service providers.&nbsp;India has since announced that the six per cent levy&mdash;often dubbed the &ldquo;Google tax&rdquo;&mdash;will be removed from April 1, 2025.&nbsp;However, data localisation rules remain. These mandate that financial and personal data be stored within India&rsquo;s borders. Cross-border data flow restrictions and limitations on cloud services continue to challenge foreign firms.&nbsp;Banking, insurance and financial services&nbsp;In banking, the report says India&rsquo;s system is dominated by state-owned banks, which account for around 60 per cent of market share and 67 per cent of branches. Foreign banks face ownership caps&mdash;74 per cent for private banks and 20 per cent for public banks&mdash;and opaque rules on branch expansion.&nbsp;In the insurance sector, India maintains a sovereign guarantee on Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) policies, which the report claims creates an unlevel playing field.&nbsp;While FDI limits were raised from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in 2021, and are expected to increase to 100 per cent, foreign insurers still face board composition requirements and higher solvency norms.&nbsp;Foreign reinsurers also face unequal treatment, with India requiring first-order preference for domestic reinsurers, the report states. In e-commerce, foreign-owned platforms are barred from selling directly to Indian consumers and can only function as neutral marketplaces. Inventory control restrictions prevent them from owning or managing stock sold on their platforms.&nbsp;In sectors like banking, telecom, and legal services, local presence and ownership requirements persist.&nbsp;Infrastructure and government procurement&nbsp;The report also highlights India&rsquo;s restrictive government procurement policies. As India is not a signatory to the WTO&rsquo;s Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), foreign firms face limited access to public tenders.&nbsp;India prioritises domestic suppliers in procurement for infrastructure, transport, and defence. Defence contracts also come with offset obligations, which are often amended without prior notice&mdash;posing compliance issues for US companies.&nbsp;Intellectual property rights&nbsp;India remains on the USTR&rsquo;s &#39;Priority Watch List&#39; due to long delays in patent and trademark processing, unclear trade secret protection, and lax enforcement against piracy and counterfeiting.&nbsp;While India has made some progress&mdash;such as launching a dedicated IP division in the Delhi High Court and expanding awareness initiatives&mdash;regulatory gaps remain.&nbsp;Bilateral engagement continues&nbsp;The USTR report acknowledges that bilateral talks through the US-India Trade Policy Forum (TPF) continue. Issues such as digital trade, IP reform, agricultural access, and services trade are being discussed.&nbsp;However, the report notes that many of the longstanding trade barriers identified in previous years remain unresolved.", "keywords": ["USTR NTE report 2025", "India tariffs on US goods", "India non-tariff barriers", "US reciprocal tariffs", "India agriculture tariffs", "India medical device regulations", "India pharmaceutical trade barriers", "donald trump tariffs", "trump reciprocal tariffs", "trump liberation day"], "date": "2025-04-01T12:50:52+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040100413", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:21:54"},

He also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s recent visit to the US and said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a great friend of mine, but I said, You&rsquo;re a friend of mine, but you&#39;re not treating us right&rsquo;. They charge us 52 per cent. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing, for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, that we started with China and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs.&rdquo;&nbsp;In his address, Trump said several countries have taken advantage of the US for generations, with many countries imposing significantly higher tariffs on American produced goods. He pointed out that while the US charges on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), the European Union (10 per cent) and India impose nearly 70 per cent on the same product, which is much higher.&nbsp;He added that the US maintains one of the lowest simple average most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariff rates in the world at 3.3 per cent, whereas India&#39;s average tariff rates stand at 17 per cent.&nbsp;India reacts to tariffs imposed&nbsp;A PTI report citing a senior official from the commerce ministry stated that the government is evaluating the economic impact of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The official added, &ldquo;The ministry is analysing the impact of the announced tariffs... It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,&rdquo; further stating that there is scope for negotiation.&nbsp;President Trump&rsquo;s administration has indicated that if a country addresses its trade concerns, the duties could be revised in their favour.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[With PTI inputs]", "keywords": ["US tariffs", "India trade impact", "Trump tariffs", "reciprocal tariffs", "trade war", "India exports", "US-India trade relations", "economic impact", "White House policy", "global trade", "import duties", "national security tariffs", "tariff barriers", "trade deficit", "India economic policy", "US trade policy", "MFN tariff rates", "automotive tariffs", "US-India commerce", "protectionist policies"], "date": "2025-04-03T10:35:38+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040300326", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:21:55"},

That comes after a 10 per cent baseline tariff for most US trading partners took effect Saturday.

The latest wave of import duties is being enforced under what the Trump administration calls a policy of &ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&rdquo; targeting nations accused of running large trade surpluses with the US.&nbsp;The tariffs start at a baseline rate of 10 per cent, which was implemented over the weekend. However, many countries face far steeper duties, ranging between 11 per cent and 84 per cent.&nbsp;Among the hardest hit is China, now facing a total tariff burden of 104 per cent on its exports to the US. This combines an earlier 20 per cent duty, a 34 per cent addition announced last week, and a last-minute 50 per cent hike signed by Trump late Tuesday.&nbsp;Reacting strongly, China&rsquo;s Commerce Ministry said, &ldquo;The US threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake... China will never accept it&hellip; China will fight to the end.&rdquo;&nbsp;Impact on India&nbsp;India, meanwhile, is subject to a 26 per cent tariff on its exports. While the US has spared some key Indian goods, such as semiconductors, copper, and pharmaceuticals, other major export categories like auto parts, gems, and jewellery are expected to take a hit.&nbsp;However, Trump said on Wednesday that the US will soon announce major tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. Notably, India supplies nearly half of all generic medicines consumed in the US.&nbsp;Sources said the Indian government is in close contact with exporters and is preparing a mitigation strategy. A high-level meeting of the Union Cabinet is scheduled today to assess the fallout and discuss ways to protect India&#39;s trade interests.&nbsp;Despite the blow, India is not planning immediate counter-tariffs, choosing instead to focus on ongoing trade negotiations. Officials say New Delhi is working toward finalising the US-India Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) that was discussed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s visit to Washington earlier this year. In March, the two countries had agreed to the terms of reference for the pact.&nbsp;A government official also told Reuters that India is hopeful of gaining relief under a clause in the US executive order, which allows for exemptions to countries that take &ldquo;significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements.&rdquo;&nbsp;After China, the countries facing the highest duties include:&nbsp;- Lesotho: 50 per cent&nbsp;- Cambodia: 49 per cent&nbsp;- Laos: 48 per cent&nbsp;- Vietnam: 46 per cent&nbsp;- Madagascar: 47 per cent&nbsp;- Taiwan: 32 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- South Korea: 25 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Japan: 24 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- European Union: 20 per cent&nbsp;Meanwhile, stock markets around the world also reacted negatively to the tariff rollout.

China&rsquo;s refusal to comply has triggered Washington to impose an unprecedented 104 per cent levy on Chinese imports.&nbsp;Earlier on Wednesday, Beijing responded to Washington&rsquo;s demands, dismissing them as coercive. &ldquo;The US threat to escalate tariffs against China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the US&rsquo;s blackmailing nature,&rdquo; China&rsquo;s commerce ministry said in a statement. The ministry further warned, &ldquo;If the US insists on having its way, China will fight to the end.&rdquo;&nbsp;US-China trade war escalatesIn February, US announced 10 per cent tariffs on China. Beijing retaliated with a 15 per cent tariff on US coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10 per cent tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-displacement cars.&nbsp;Trump criticised this, claiming that China&rsquo;s significantly higher tariffs had unfairly drained billions from the US economy. US raised tariffs by another 10 per cent, bringing levies against Chinese imports to 20 per cent. China retaliated by imposing a 15 per cent tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, and a 10 per cent tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.&nbsp;In response, Trump introduced a &quot;reciprocal tariff&quot; policy, which imposed a rate equivalent to half of the tariffs levied by any given country on US exports. This meant an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, resulting in a cumulative tariff rate of 54 per cent. Now, with the latest additional 50 per cent tariff specifically targeting China, Beijing is facing an unprecedented levy of 104 per cent, nearly doubling its tariff obligations within a week.&nbsp;Despite the escalation, Trump indicated that he was open to negotiations.&nbsp;&nbsp;China has also been calling for trade talks with the US since Trump first announced tariff hikes.

Days into the effort, it&#39;s meeting only partial success from countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump&#39;s trade war.Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favorable conditions.China has refused to seek talks, saying the US was insincere and that it will fight to the end in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday.Trump&#39;s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China.China has thus far focused on Europe, with a phone call between Premier Li Qiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sending a positive message to the outside world. The two are each other&#39;s largest trading partners.China is willing to work with the EU to jointly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of China and the EU, strengthen communication and exchanges, and deepen China-EU trade, investment and industrial cooperation, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.That was followed by a video conference between Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security efcovic on Tuesday to discuss the US reciprocal tariffs.Wang said the tariffs seriously infringe upon the legitimate interests of all countries, seriously violate WTO rules, seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impact the stability of the global economic order, Xinhua said.It is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying, Wang said quoted as saying.China is willing to resolve differences through consultation and negotiation, but if the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end, Wang said.Wang has also spoken with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, while Li, the premier, has met with business leaders. China has already made a full evaluation and is prepared to deal with all kinds of uncertainties, and will introduce incremental policies according to the needs of the situation, Xinhua quoted Li as saying.Not all countries are interested in linking up with China, especially those with a history of disputes with Beijing.We speak for ourselves, and Australia&#39;s position is that free and fair trade is a good thing,&quot; Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters. We engage with all countries, but we stand up for Australia&#39;s national interest and we stand on our own two feet.China imposed a series of official and unofficial trade barriers against Australia in 2020 after the then-government angered Beijing by calling for an independent inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic.India has also reportedly turned down a Chinese call for cooperation, and Russia, typically seen as China&#39;s closest geopolitical partner, has been left out of the Trump tariffs altogether.Yet, Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam and Cambodia find themselves in a particular bind. They benefited when factories moved to their countries from China due to rising costs. They are being hit by punishing tariffs but have few buyers outside the US and are already operating on razor-thin margins.Trump had previously denied contemplating a pause, but the drama over his tariffs will continue as the administration prepares to engage in country-by-country negotiations.

The rebels meanwhile aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.The 13 killed in strikes Tuesday night around Hodeida&#39;s al-Hawak district made it one of the deadliest single incidents in the ongoing American campaign, the rebels said. Another 15 people were wounded. The Houthis described the majority of those killed as women and children, without providing a breakdown.The area is home to the city&#39;s airport, which the rebels have used in the past to target shipping in the Red Sea.Since its start, the intense campaign of US airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters related to the Israel-Hamas war has killed over 100 people, according to casualty figures released Wednesday by the Houthis.Footage aired by the rebels&#39; al-Masirah satellite news channel showed chaotic scenes of people carrying wounded to waiting ambulances and rescuers searching by the light of their mobile phones. The target appeared in the footage to be a home in a residential neighbourhood, likely part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders.Early Thursday morning, the Houthis said airstrikes targeting the al-Sabeen District in the south of the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, killed at least three people. The area is home to al-Sabeen Square and a major mosque that has been a gathering point for months for Houthi demonstrations against the war in the Gaza Strip. Other strikes hit the capital as well.More airstrikes hit Kamaran Island in the Red Sea, the Houthis said.The US military&#39;s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorisation from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15.The American military also hasn&#39;t been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that America was not going to relent in its campaign targeting the Houthis.Oil shipments targeted as US drone reportedly shot down&nbsp;On Wednesday, the State Department said the US will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organisations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports. That likely will further squeeze the rebels, who already have had problems in their territory with bad gasoline destroying vehicle engines.The Houthis also aired footage of the burning wreckage of what they described as an MQ-9 Reaper drone shot down in Yemen&#39;s al-Jawaf governorate. One man poked at the debris with a stick as those gathered chanted the Houthis&#39; slogan: God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.Central Command said it was aware of the report of the shoot down, but declined to answer further.The Houthis say they shoot down the drones with locally made missiles. The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 capable of downing aircraft.Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 metres) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the US military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen.The Houthis claim they&#39;ve shot down 22 MQ-9s over the country over the years, with 18 downed during the rebels&#39; campaign over the Israel-Hamas war.The US military hasn&#39;t acknowledged the total number of drones it has lost there.US airstrikes under Trump more intense than those under Biden&nbsp;An AP review has found the new US operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting Israeli ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.The US campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear programme as well.", "keywords": ["US airstrikes", "Yemen", "Houthis", "Houthi rebels", "death toll", "airstrikes"], "date": "2025-04-10T08:42:24+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000116", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:54"},

They can&rsquo;t play with the law. Liquidation is the only option remaining,&rdquo; Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkataraman said.SBI told the court that the total admitted claim of the financial creditor is close to Rs 7,800 crore and the financial package offered by the SRA (Successful Resolution Applicant, that is, JKC) in the Resolution Plan was Rs 4,783 crore, which is payable in tranches in five years.The first tranche payment of Rs 350 crore was required to be made by March 21, 2022. This amount has not been paid to date despite several extensions and exclusions granted to the SRA by the NCLT, NCLAT, and SC.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are struggling for the first tranche of Rs 350 crore. The resolution plan is effective for 180 days. Lenders are incurring Rs 22 crore every month to maintain the Corporate Debtor (Jet Airways),&rdquo; the ASG said.&nbsp;He had also told the court earlier that even the NCLAT&rsquo;s order directing the SRA (to belatedly) create security by mortgaging Dubai properties within 30 days of its order, has not been complied with.Meanwhile, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for JKC, the successful bidder for bankrupt Jet Airways, alleged in the Supreme Court that the SBI brought down Air India and Kingfisher airlines.&ldquo;They have brought down Air India, Kingfisher. Ten separate pleas have been filed by them (SBI) against airlines. Only two airlines are left. They will bring down everything. No airline will remain,&rdquo; Rohatgi alleged in the court.JKC told the court that the lenders do not &quot;give them the key&rdquo; to access their grounded aircraft on the airport premises.&nbsp; &nbsp;The apex court will now hear the arguments by JKC on Tuesday.The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had on March 12 greenlit the transfer of ownership of Jet Airways to JKC.NCLAT had told JKC to obtain an air operator&rsquo;s certificate within 90 days from March 12. It had also given it more time to pay Rs 175 crore to SBI as 107 days had passed since NCLAT&#39;s order allowing the transfer of ownership.It upheld the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which had permitted the transfer of ownership to JKC in January last year. Consequently, the appeal by the SBI against the takeover of the airline by JKC was dismissed.The lenders then appealed against this order in the Supreme Court.Among the airlines in India, Go First had filed for voluntary insolvency on May 2, 2023, under Section 10 of the IBC, and on May 10, 2023, and the NCLT admitted its insolvency plea.The grounded airline joined the ranks of major carriers such as Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways, which went to the wall in 2012 and 2019, respectively, underscoring the challenges inherent in navigating India&rsquo;s aviation industry.On the other hand, the Tatas took over Air India on January 27, 2022 and chose SBI, Bank of Baroda and HDFC Bank as preferred bankers for the airline. On February 29, 2024, Air India refinanced short-term loans with the SBI and Bank of Baroda (BoB) for a three-year loan, replacing the short-term Rs 18,000 crore bridge loan Air India had availed from SBI and BoB to complete the Tata group&#39;s takeover of the national carrier in January 2022.&nbsp;.storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}", "keywords": ["sbi", "Kingfisher", "Air India", "Supreme Court"], "date": "2024-09-26T21:56:41+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124092601211", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:54"},

This mandate, announced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will be enforced at security checkpoints in airports nationwide.&nbsp;What is a REAL ID?&nbsp;REAL ID is a federal compliant driver&#39;s licence, learner permit, or non-driver ID issued by state departments of motor vehicles (DMVs). It features enhanced security measures designed to reduce identity fraud and improve national security, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The most distinctive feature of a REAL ID is a star emblem located in the upper right corner, which indicates compliance with federal standards.&nbsp;Why is REAL ID Required?&nbsp;The REAL ID Act was enacted in 2005 to enhance security measures following the events of September 11, 2001. By setting stricter standards for state-issued IDs, the government aims to ensure that all identification used for federal purposes meets specific identity verification requirements. This includes boarding domestic flights, entering federal facilities, and accessing military bases.&nbsp;How to Get a REAL ID?&nbsp;To obtain a REAL ID, you must visit your local DMV or Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) office. The application process typically requires in-person attendance, and you will need to provide specific documents.&nbsp;Proof of identity: This can include a US birth certificate, valid US passport, or other approved documents.&nbsp;Proof of social security number: A social security card or W-2 form is usually required.&nbsp;Proof of residency: You may need to provide multiple documents showing your current address, such as utility bills or lease agreements.&nbsp;Costs Associated with REAL ID&nbsp;In most states, obtaining a REAL ID does not incur additional costs beyond standard DMV fees for driver&#39;s licences or ID cards.

HNW depositors can benefit from higher rates available on non-callable deposits,&rdquo; said Shetty.&nbsp;For those worried about inflation, he suggested keeping some exposure to equities. &ldquo;Senior citizens should use FDs for stable income, but must also allocate a portion of their portfolio into equities for inflation-adjusted returns,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Wider portfolio planning in a falling rate cycle&nbsp;Aman Gupta, director of RPS Group, said FD investors must be more active in tracking policy trends. &ldquo;Start with banks and NBFCs that offer the best rates&mdash;small finance banks tend to pay 0.5&ndash;1% higher than the more orthodox banks,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Gupta said tax treatment also plays a role. &ldquo;Post FD returns after the tax slab are not inflation-indexed; tax saving FDs or Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) outperform inflation post taxation and therefore are better alternatives,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;He also pointed to hybrid options. &ldquo;Channel a portion of the savings towards instruments such as arbitrage or conservative hybrid funds which offer better stability than equities but tend to be volatile relative to bonds,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;He added that investors should avoid defaulting to high-risk assets. &ldquo;Sustain an emergency cash fund of 6&ndash;12 months of expenses while alternatives are explored,&rdquo; Gupta said.&nbsp;Explore staggered investments&nbsp;Siddharth Maurya, founder and managing director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited, suggested breaking up FD investments across different tenures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Try out debt mutual funds, corporate bonds, or RBI floating rate savings bonds as they may yield superior returns after tax,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Employ FD laddering&mdash;divide your portfolio into several FDs with staggered maturities, for example, 1, 2 and 3 years.&rdquo;&nbsp;He also advised checking renewal dates. &ldquo;If you have shorter-term deposits, make sure to renew them reliably to bypass auto-renewal at devalued rates,&rdquo; said Maurya.&nbsp;&quot;Investors can also look for an option of corporate deposits like Shriram Finance Ltd, Mahindra Finance Ltd, Bajaj Finance Ltd, PNB Housing Finance Ltd which are offering higher rates than banks and can give 100 bps extra point which can matter alot while investing substantial amount,&quot; said&nbsp;Bharat Mundada, Director, Mundada Finserv Private Limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shetty also listed a few strategies to consider:&nbsp;Lock in current FD rates: Consider locking in funds now for medium to long-term tenures.&nbsp;Use laddering: Break up FDs into different maturity periods to manage reinvestment risk and maintain liquidity.&nbsp;Explore small savings schemes: Schemes like SCSS or POMIS can offer better yields for risk-averse investors.&nbsp;Look at AAA-rated corporate FDs and debt mutual funds: These may offer slightly higher returns, though with some market or credit risk.&nbsp;The cut in repo rate comes amid global economic shifts.

This upward momentum is further supported by the sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, marking their eighth consecutive day of gains with an additional $27 million. &quot;Such institutional interest underlines confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset, particularly amid macroeconomic uncertainties,&quot; said Sehgal.&nbsp;Alankar Saxena, CTO and co-founder of Mudrex, on the other hand, believes that if strong buying pressure pushes Bitcoin toward $90,000, a breakout could trigger a series of liquidations, fueling a rally to new highs. &quot;BTC faces its next major resistance at $89,500,&quot; said Saxena.&nbsp;However, Ethereum (ETH), which is the world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, faced downward pressure after failing to maintain levels above $2,100, sliding below key support zones. Ethereum was quoted trading at around $2,019.40, down 2.45 percent.&nbsp;The continuous outflow from Ethereum ETFs, Sehgal believes, signals a more cautious sentiment. &quot;Adding to the market&#39;s volatility is the uncertainty around US trade policy.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, surged by over 10 per cent, reaching a peak of $94,821. Ethereum experienced a 12 per cent rise, while XRP, Solana, and Cardano saw even more substantial gains of 30 per cent, 20 per cent, and over 50 per cent, respectively, according to data shared by MarketWatch.&nbsp;Why Trump loves crypto&nbsp;In his second term, Trump&rsquo;s crypto policy has seen a departure from his previous regulatory approach. Previously, he had labelled cryptocurrencies as a &lsquo;scam&rsquo; and advocated for heavy regulation to prevent competition with the US dollar. However, during his 2024 election campaign, Trump garnered significant support from the crypto industry, pledging to foster a more favourable environment for digital assets.&nbsp;The previous Joe Biden administration adopted a more cautious and regulatory-focused approach toward cryptocurrencies. For instance, in May 2023, the administration proposed a 30 per cent tax on cryptocurrency miners&rsquo; energy costs, aiming to address environmental concerns associated with mining activities. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Biden&rsquo;s tenure pursued numerous enforcement actions against major crypto entities, reflecting a stringent regulatory stance.&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s current policies, including the nomination of crypto supporter Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chairman, indicate a more favourable outlook toward the crypto industry. His administration has since withdrawn investigations into several crypto companies and dismissed a lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.&nbsp;In January this year, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the creation of a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to solidify the United States&rsquo; leadership in digital financial technology and to establish regulatory clarity in the rapidly evolving digital asset sector.&nbsp;What US Strategic Crypto Reserve is expected to do&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s idea behind establishing the Crypto Strategic Reserve is to enhance the legitimacy and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased institutional adoption and integration into traditional financial systems.&nbsp;Besides, this initiative could influence regulatory approaches to digital assets. By holding a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, the US government might be better positioned to influence global crypto regulations and standards. This move could also prompt other nations to consider similar reserves, potentially leading to a more coordinated international regulatory environment.&nbsp;While the announcement has been met with optimism by the crypto market, several operational aspects remain unclear. The mechanisms for acquiring and managing the cryptocurrencies within the reserve have yet to be detailed.&nbsp;The US government currently holds an estimated $19 billion in Bitcoin, primarily acquired through seizures linked to criminal cases.

It has also not imposed an outright ban on it.&nbsp;Reuters reported last year that India&#39;s market regulator has signaled it is open to oversight of crypto trade, but the government is still to take a view.&nbsp;The central bank, though, has continued to warn against it.&nbsp;&quot;Widespread usage of crypto assets and stablecoins has consequences for macroeconomic and financial stability,&quot; it said in its Financial Stability Report in December 2024.&nbsp;India&#39;s federal finance ministry, the central bank and the market regulator did not respond to emails seeking comment.&nbsp;(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Cryptocurrency", "Crypto trading", "Indian economy", "job growth", "income", "Youth"], "date": "2025-02-25T06:58:11+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125022500080", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:55"},

We hope that this will bring much-needed awareness about crypto crimes and serve as a practical resource for law enforcement agencies. We have taken great care to cover all legal provisions and elaborate on various scenarios so that agencies can understand the nature of crypto offences and are equipped with the tools necessary to investigate them.

If banks fully pass on the rate cut, such loan customers could see a decrease of 25 basis points (0.25 per cent) in their interest rates.&nbsp;&ldquo;The RBI&rsquo;s latest move to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent can make car loans more affordable.

{"url": "https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/upi-transaction-limits-set-for-revision-what-rbi-decision-means-for-you-125040900571_1.html", "title": "UPI transaction limits set for revision: What RBI decision means for you", "content": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday announced an update to the transaction limits on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allowing for greater flexibility in both Person-to-Person (P2P) and Person-to-Merchant (P2M) payments. Currently, the limit for UPI transactions is capped at Rs 1 lakh, with some P2M transactions allowing limits of Rs 2 lakh or Rs 5 lakh. Under the new guidelines, these limits will be revised based on evolving user needs, with appropriate security measures in place to mitigate risks associated with higher transaction amounts.&nbsp;&quot;To enable the ecosystem to respond efficiently to new use cases, it is proposed that NPCI, in consultation with banks and other stakeholders of the UPI ecosystem, may announce and revise such limits based on evolving user needs. Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to mitigate risks associated with higher limits. Banks shall continue to have the discretion to decide their own internal limits within the limits announced by NPCI,&quot; RBI said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;P2P transactions on UPI shall continue to be capped at Rs 1 lakh, as hitherto. NPCI will be advised accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Does This Mean for You?1. Larger transactions made easierFor most users, the Rs 1 lakh cap on UPI payments has not been an issue. But as digital transactions grow, so do the needs of businesses and individuals. Whether you&#39;re paying for a high-ticket item, making a bulk payment, or engaging in larger financial transactions, the move to increase UPI transaction limits means you&#39;ll be able to do more through the same simple and secure platform.&nbsp;For example, if you are running a small business or frequently making payments for goods or services worth more than \u20b91 lakh, this new flexibility could save you from the hassle of splitting payments into multiple transactions. With a revised limit, UPI could become an even more convenient tool for larger payments.&nbsp;&quot;Currently, P2P UPI payments are capped at \u20b91 lakh, and P2M payments at \u20b93-5 lakh. The RBI wants to revisit these limits to accommodate new use cases. UPI payments are now accepted in select countries abroad, so this may be one of the use cases. On the whole, on the retail side, UPI payments are actually getting smaller. While transactions have grown 33% February-on-February to 16 billion payments moving \u20b922 trillion for the month, the average UPI payment in February 2025 was \u20b91364 compared to \u20b91510 the previous February. This reveals that reliance on UPI for small-ticket payments is increasing,&quot; said Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com&nbsp;2. Security Measures to Keep You SafeWhile the transaction limits are set to increase, the RBI and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) have assured users that adequate safeguards will be in place to prevent fraud and mitigate risks. So, while you&#39;ll have the ability to make larger transactions, the security of your payments remains a top priority. These additional checks are designed to ensure that the growth in transaction limits does not compromise the safety and trust that users have come to expect from UPI.&nbsp;You can expect additional layers of verification for large transactions, which may include two-factor authentication or even biometrics, to add extra security.&nbsp;3. Bank-Specific Limits Still ApplyWhile NPCI will revise the overall transaction limits, each bank will still have the discretion to set its own internal limits. This means that while the system as a whole will be more flexible, your bank might have its own set of policies on how much you can transfer in a single UPI transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;4. P2P Transactions Remain UnchangedIf you regularly transfer money to friends, family, or colleagues, you&#39;ll still be bound by the Rs 1 lakh limit for Person-to-Person (P2P) transactions. The cap for P2P payments will remain unchanged for now, so smaller, day-to-day transfers are unaffected by this new rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "keywords": ["RBI MPC", "UPI", "UPI limit", "Home loans", "Fixed deposit", "FD interest rate", "RBI mpc meeting june 2023", "FD interest rate news", "fixed deposits rate", "RBI"], "date": "2025-04-09T13:50:15+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900571", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:55"},

Without it, many of these applicants lose an essential safeguard and advocate within the immigration system,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;H-1B applicants face longer waits, fewer options&nbsp;According to Rothfeld, the H-1B process is already complex and often marked by delays or arbitrary denials. &ldquo;The loss of access to an ombudsman means there is one less avenue for addressing unreasonable delays or reporting issues with policy implementation. For green card applicants, the impact is similarly severe, especially for those experiencing backlogs or seeking to rectify administrative errors without sufficient recourse,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;At K Altman Law, we view this development as a step backward for due process. We urge continued oversight and the preservation of mechanisms that protect fairness and transparency in immigration&mdash;especially for those who contribute so meaningfully to American institutions and innovation,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;OPT rejections, visa extensions stalled&nbsp;Students were also frequent users of the office, especially when their optional practical training (OPT) applications were mishandled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Students frequently sought help when their optional practical training (OPT) applications were mishandled, threatening job offers they had already accepted,&rdquo; wrote Rajiv S Khanna, an immigration lawyer based in Arlington, on immigration.com.&nbsp;He cited a case involving an F-1 student whose OPT application was wrongly rejected after USCIS misread her paperwork. &ldquo;She had already missed her start date with a major tech company when we approached the CIS Ombudsman. They quickly identified the error and facilitated reopening of the case, saving both her job and legal status,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Delays with H-1B extensions were another common issue. &ldquo;In one instance, an engineer from Bangalore had his H-1B extension pending for 11 months despite multiple service requests. His employer was considering termination, and he faced losing his home. After the Ombudsman&rsquo;s intervention, approval came within two weeks,&rdquo; Khanna wrote.&nbsp;Indians still form largest H-1B group&nbsp;Indian professionals continue to be the largest recipients of the H-1B visa. Around 191,000 visas were granted to Indians in the 2023 financial year. That number rose to about 207,000 in FY 2024.&nbsp;But securing the visa is just the first step. The real challenge begins with the wait for permanent residency. For Indian nationals, that process often stretches across decades due to strict annual limits and per-country caps.&nbsp;According to US government data, over one million Indians are currently stuck in employment-based green card backlogs. These delays, immigration lawyers say, can derail lives and make it harder for the US to retain skilled talent.&nbsp;An H-1B denial, a layoff, or even an economic downturn could leave workers with no option but to leave the country&mdash;despite years of legal residence.&nbsp;&ldquo;From an Indian perspective, where a large volume of highly skilled professionals depend on the H-1B program and await green card approvals for years, this move adds another layer of uncertainty,&rdquo; said Singh. &ldquo;It emphasises the need for applicants to work with experienced immigration professionals who can help navigate these challenges and advocate effectively within the system.&rdquo;", "keywords": ["US immigration", "USCIS Ombudsman shut", "H-1B visa help desk closed", "F-1 student visa issues", "green card backlog India", "immigration delay USA", "OPT rejection help", "H-1B extension delays", "US visa legal limbo", "Indian immigrants US", "Trump immigration changes"], "date": "2025-04-09T15:51:34+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040700808", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:56"},

ICICI Securities Limited and JM Financial Limited are the book running lead managers for the offering.&nbsp;Backed by venture capital firm WestBridge Capital and noted investor Ashish Gupta, IndiQube operates with 103 centres across 13 cities, including six Tier-II cities, with a portfolio spanning 7.76 million square feet and a total capacity of 172,451 seats as of June 30, 2024.&nbsp;Founded in 2015, IndiQube&#39;s client base includes global capability centres (GCCs), Indian corporates, unicorns and startups, with names like Myntra, upGrad, Zerodha, NoBroker, Redbus, Juspay, Perfios, Moglix, Ninjacart, Siemens and Narayana Health.&nbsp;The flex operator reported total revenue of Rs 867.6 crore in FY24 as against Rs 601.2 crore in FY23. The company&rsquo;s FY24 Ebitda stood at Rs 263.4 crore, while for Q1FY25 itself, the Ebitda was Rs 153 crore.&nbsp;IndiQube competes with the likes of Awfis, Table Space, Stylework, WeWork, The Executive Center and 315Work Avenue. New Delhi-based Awfis Space Solutions&rsquo; Rs 598.93 crore IPO in 2024 marked India&rsquo;s first public offering in the flex office segment. Bengaluru&rsquo;s Table Space is reportedly preparing for a high-value IPO this year, while Gurugram-based Stylework targets a 2028 listing. Additionally, 315Work Avenue plans to raise Rs 400 crore to fuel its growth, while Sebi has put WeWork on hold.&nbsp;In Q1FY25, India&#39;s flex office segment expanded, with flex space leasing rising 22 per cent to 2.2 million square feet, according to Colliers. Bengaluru, Delhi NCR and Pune accounted for about 80 per cent of the uptake.

Cyber insurance helps recover losses from cyberattacks", "content": "In 2023, India ranked third globally in terms of the number of phishing attacks after USA and the UK. About 33 per cent&nbsp; of all phishing attacks in India were targeted at the critical infrastructure industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2023, hackers breached the ICMR database and stole about 815 million Indians&rsquo; personally identifiable information (PII) details, and did an exfiltration of the same to the dark web.&nbsp;In Dec 2023, hackers breached BSNL and stolen &lsquo;critical information&rsquo; of about 30,000 optical fibre landline users&rsquo; data and network characteristics and made it available on the dark web.&nbsp;The Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) has reported that the RailYatri app has encountered forty-two incidents of data breach in the past five years, and that this data was on sale on the dark web.&nbsp;During the G-20 summit in 2023, cyber-hackers like Ganonsec, Jambi Cyber Team, and Hacktivist Indonesia attacked the official website of the conference with 16 lakh Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks per minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a Checkpoint report, an Indian organization on average has experienced 2,807 attacks each week during the first quarter of 2024, a 33 per cent increase in cyberattacks in the first quarter of 2024 over the corresponding period last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2025, it is estimated that the number of internet users in India will grow by 15.7 per cent and reach 900 million people as compared to 821 million in the current year. This will push organizations in India to increase adoption of AI, digital business decentralization, and dependence on supply chain with cloud services. The growth of the internet will also provide a great impetus to the digital India mission, leading to the growth of digital public infrastructure (DPI) in India such as Aadhaar, DigiLocker and UPI-based payments.&nbsp;On studying the daily vulnerability notes of (CERT-In), it follows those that all software, network and hardware commonly used by organizations and individuals are at risk. So, banking, financial services, IT, healthcare, and e-commerce sectors are going to be prone to cyber-attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most organizations in line with briefings, such as those from CERT-In, National Critical Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) and sector-specific inputs from RBI and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), resort to use of security technologies (like firewall, antivirus, intrusion detection system, and end point detection response system), vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing (VAPT), along with IT audits and regular security training. This helps in most cases to reduce or deter the probability of cyber-attacks. But in most cases, a smart attacker may still be able to outwit the IT security technologies and launch a cyber-attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cybersecurity market in India has grown to $6.06 billion by 2023. The use of technology helps to prevent and detect cyber threats and threat surface. As a next step, organizations resort to transferring the residual risk to a cyber-risk insurer.&nbsp;In India, cyber insurance is provided by Bajaj Allianz, ICICI Lombard, SBI Insurance, and HDFC ERGO for individuals and companies. The cyber-risk insurers cover cyber threats, business interruptions, cyber frauds and cyber-attacks (such as identity theft, phishing and email spoofing, damage to email reputation, cyber extortion, replacement of hardware, cyber bullying, cyber stalking, smart home coverage, online shopping, malware attack, IT theft loss, multimedia liability, online sales, network security liability, privacy breach , data breach, privacy breach by third party, liability arising due to underage dependent children, theft of funds due to unauthorised physical transaction). With premiums ranging between approximately Rs 2,000 to Rs. 5000 per month, cyber insurance offers an affordable means of securing comprehensive protection against cyber-attacks.&nbsp;In 2020, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had set up a working group to study cyber liability insurance. The main objective was to provide suggestions to popularise cyber insurance in India. The working group had provided their recommendations regarding framing of cyber risk insurance policy, the process for claim settlement, and steps to increase the awareness about cyber insurance.&nbsp;With the passing of the Digital Personal Data Protection Data (PDPD) Act, in 2023, the government of India intends to focus strongly on stringent protection of citizens&rsquo; data. So cyber insurance policies can cover organizations and data fiduciaries against losses arising from violation of DPDP norms. Thus, cyber-risk insurance helps to provide a supplementary financial tool after the initial investment in IT security tools. Cyber risk insurers can help to make good the loss arising from a cyberattack.&nbsp;The writers are, respectively, a faculty member and PhD students at IIM (Lucknow).

He underscored the need to strengthen cybersecurity to safeguard against digital threats.The report said NIM for SFBs is expected to contract 15 bps as they continue diversifying to secured asset classes, which have relatively lower yields.Credit cost, meanwhile, may rise to about 40 bps because of rising delinquencies, primarily in the microfinance and other unsecured segments, it said.An uptick in delinquencies, albeit more controlled, is also likely in sub-segments of secured assets classes catering to a similar customer segment.&quot;SFBs have been focusing on segmental diversification as a core growth strategy.

Instead, they should be viewed as episodes that can occur in a financial system which has a large number of players, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday. He, however, reassured that overall India&rsquo;s financial system remains resilient.&nbsp;In the post-monetary policy press conference, Malhotra said: &ldquo;I would not call them total failures. They are episodes and we have to ensure through various means that these incidents happen lesser in frequency. For that, we have various tools &ndash; regulations, supervision, etc. The banks themselves have multiple layers &ndash; business unit layer, compliance layer, and audit layer. So, all of them have to work together and continuously try to improve the systems.&rdquo;&nbsp;Additionally, he assured that India&#39;s financial system remains resilient. Be it cooperative banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), or scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), at the system level they are safe, secure, and robust, Malhotra said, adding that RBI has good systems in place to detect non-compliances and risks as early as possible and it takes pre-emptive as well as corrective action wherever required.&nbsp;In his statement, Malhotra emphasised that financial soundness parameters of the banking sector continue to be robust. The liquidity buffer in the banking system is well above the regulatory threshold and profitability indicators are also healthy, reflecting robust operational efficiency of the system. Similarly, the system-level parameters of NBFCs too are sound, he said.&nbsp;Last month, IndusInd disclosed to the exchanges that an internal review of processes related to its derivative portfolio revealed certain discrepancies, which will adversely impact its net worth by 2.35 per cent. Analysts estimate the hit on profit to be between \u20b91,500 crore and \u20b92,000 crore.&nbsp;The bank has appointed an external agency &ndash; PwC &ndash; to independently review and validate the internal findings. Additionally, the bank has hired an independent professional firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify the root cause of the discrepancies in the derivative portfolio of the bank. The firm has also been tasked with assessing the correctness and impact of the accounting treatment of the derivative contracts with regard to the prevailing accounting standards, as well as identifying any lapses and establishing accountability.&nbsp;Amidst the turmoil, the central bank had to step in to issue a statement, addressing speculations surrounding the bank. The RBI assured the bank&rsquo;s depositors to not react to speculative reports as the bank&rsquo;s financial health remains stable and is being monitored closely by it.&nbsp;In case of New India Cooperative Bank, the RBI superseded its board for 12 months and appointed an administrator to oversee the bank&rsquo;s affairs during this period, after imposing business restrictions on the bank. These actions of the RBI were triggered by allegations of fund misappropriation by some bank staffers.&nbsp;Additionally, the RBI in January superseded the board of Aviom India Housing Finance, citing governance concerns, and referred the lender to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to initiate insolvency proceedings.&nbsp;&ldquo;Whenever such failures happen, we take risk-mitigation measures in terms of protecting the customers but also on the other side, we direct the boards to ensure that proper forensic and accountability studies are held so that whomsoever is accountable, whether they internal, external, or third-party service provider, they will be covered and actions will play out,&rdquo; said RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan J.&nbsp;&ldquo;We never waste a crisis,&rdquo; he said, adding that there are learnings and the supervisory tools get better with each episode.&nbsp;According to Swaminathan, RBI&rsquo;s intention is to minimise and, more importantly, ensure that customers remain protected even if accidents play out. &ldquo;In each of the episodes, we have taken adequate steps to ensure that customer inconvenience is minimised and customer money is protected to the extent as much as possible,&rdquo; he further said.", "keywords": ["RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra", "IndusInd Bank incident", "New India Cooperative Bank episode", "Indian financial system resilience", "RBI press conference highlights", "RBI regulations and supervision", "financial sector risk management", "cooperative banks stability India", "NBFCs in India 2025", "scheduled commercial banks safety", "RBI corrective actions", "RBI pre-emptive measures", "financial sector compliance layers", "RBI audit and compliance", "Indian banking system robustness", "RBI tools for financial oversight", "RBI statement on bank failures", "Sanjay Malhotra monetary policy briefing", "financial system integrity India", "non-compliance detection RBI"], "date": "2025-04-09T23:48:48+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900931", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:57"},

Few fund houses like Edelweiss and PPFAS took the hybrid fund route to fill the gap by creating tax-efficient lower-risk products.&nbsp;The change in the tax structure of FoFs in the latest Budget has opened the room for more possibilities.The two proposed products, HDFC Debt Advantage FoF and ABSL Income Optimiser FoF, will invest over 35 per cent of the corpus each in arbitrage funds and debt-oriented schemes. They plan to cap the maximum allocation to the two schemes at less than 65 per cent, according to the fund drafts available on Securities and Exchange Board of India&#39;s (Sebi) website.The launch of the FoFs is subject to approvals from the regulator.FoFs invest in one or multiple MF schemes rather than buying securities directly. According to the new tax rules, FoFs investing less than 65 per cent in debt funds will qualify for long-term capital gains tax benefit i.e., the gains will be taxed at 12.5 per cent if the investor stays invested for more than two years.&quot;Such offerings can find a place in investor portfolios, given the tax advantage. However, much will depend on the debt funds they invest in and how well they are managed. In addition, the expense ratio should be reasonable for the fund to compete with other lower-risk investment options,&quot; said Rushabh Desai, Founder, Rupee With Rushabh.Expense ratios of FoFs are generally higher as investors have to pay expenses for both FoF and its underlying funds.Since the change in debt fund taxation, arbitrage funds have emerged as the preferred debt fund alternative. In the last year, these schemes have raked in over Rs 1 trillion, largely driven by their strong performance and equity taxation.Experts say the proposed FoFs can compete with arbitrage funds, provided they are managed well.&quot;Given the mix of arbitrage and debt allocation, the predictability of returns can be higher in the case of these FoFs compared to pure arbitrage funds,&rdquo; said Rahul Jain, senior vice-president research, International Money Matters.&ldquo;The FoFs will have an added advantage if the fund manager has ample flexibility to shift between various debt funds to make the best out of the prevailing market condition,&quot; Jain said.Other low- to moderate-risk tax-efficient options- Edelweiss Multi Asset Allocation Fund- Parag Parikh Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund- Select schemes in equity savings category", "keywords": ["Mutual Funds", "Markets", "mf", "investment"], "date": "2024-09-26T23:38:11+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124092600704", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:57"},

The move is part of the group&#39;s strategy to list its financial arm while safeguarding sensitive business information, Moneycontrol reported on Friday citing sources.&nbsp;Details of Tata Capital IPOTata Capital, a non-banking financial services (NBFC) firm and a subsidiary of Tata Sons, has engaged 10 investment banks as advisors for the listing. The banks include Kotak Mahindra Capital, Citi, JP Morgan, Axis Capital, ICICI Securities, HSBC Securities, IIFL Capital, BNP Paribas, SBI Capital, and HDFC Bank.&nbsp;The report indicates that the IPO will consist of a combination of primary and secondary share offerings, with Tata Sons and investor International Finance Corporation (IFC) planning to reduce their stakes. However, Tata Sons is expected to play a more significant role in the stake sale.&nbsp;On February 25, Tata Capital&rsquo;s board approved the IPO, comprising a fresh issue of up to 230 million shares along with an offer for sale by existing shareholders. The IPO is subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals.&nbsp;Tata Sons&rsquo; holding and market standingAs of March 31, 2024, Tata Sons directly owned 92.83 per cent of Tata Capital, while the remaining shares were held by other Tata Group entities and IFC. The public listing is not expected to reduce Tata Sons&#39; stake below 75 per cent in the near future, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report.&nbsp;Ahead of the IPO, Tata Capital&rsquo;s board also cleared a \u20b91,504 crore rights issue in February. Tata Sons is expected to subscribe to the entire rights issue to support the company&rsquo;s financial needs.&nbsp;Growth and financial positionTata Capital is a systemically important, non-deposit-taking, Core Investment Company registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

This method helps protect proprietary information from competitors and market speculation. Companies can decide whether to proceed with the IPO after receiving Sebi&rsquo;s observations. If they choose not to proceed, they can withdraw without public scrutiny.

This is in addition to the already available bidding route (RBB). Whether in a given scenario, one will use the new route or the old one, will have to be assessed based on what the key public shareholders will accept. In many cases, promoters will still opt for RBB, as a counter offer mechanism is available under that route alone,&rdquo; said Gautam Gandotra, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.Sebi has specified metrics for the calculation of the floor price of the equity shares proposed to be delisted through the reverse book building (RBB) process or through the fixed price process.The regulator noted that it should not be less than the highest paid for any acquisition during the 26 weeks preceding the reference date, volume weighted average price paid by an acquirer during 52 weeks preceding the reference date, or adjusted book value, among other criteria.&nbsp;The RBB framework is considered to be very stringent as the delisting price arrived using this process is often quite high, making the offer untenable.Though the amendments have been made effective from September 25, any acquirer may make the delisting offer as per the previous norms till the next two months.Further, Sebi has reduced the threshold under the counter offer mechanism to 75 per cent from 90 per cent of public shareholders.&nbsp;Under the RBB process, the delisting process is considered successful if the post-offer aggregate shareholding of the promoter or the acquirer reaches 90 per cent.&ldquo;In case of delisting through reverse book building process; a counter-offer may be made by the acquirer to the public shareholders, provided the post-offer shareholding of the acquirer, along with the shares tendered by public shareholders, is not less than 75 per cent and not less than 50 per cent of the public shareholding has been tendered,&rdquo; reads the regulation.For delisting of investment holding companies, Sebi specified that to be eligible, the holdco should have at least 75 per cent of its fair value comprising direct investments in equity shares of other listed companies.This fair value will be determined through a joint report by two independent valuers.The market regulator has pointed out that the shares of the holdcos which get delisted will not be permitted to seek relisting for a period of three years from the date of delisting.... simplifies reporting system for participants, launches UDiFF&nbsp;In a move to promote ease of doing business, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has introduced the Unified Distilled File Formats (UDiFF), a standardised reporting system for trading members, clearing members, and depository participants. Previously, these entities had to file over&nbsp;&nbsp;200 proprietary report formats daily with their respective market infrastructure institutions (MIIs). However, Sebi&rsquo;s initiative has reduced this number to just 23 formats, conforming to international ISO standards.&nbsp;The key benefit of this initiative is an estimated savings of Rs 200 crore over five years due to lower operational expenses, Sebi said in a&nbsp; release. UDiFF will also help lower integration costs for new fintechs and make the MII-Member interface interoperable with no additional development costs. The UDiFF implementation was phased, with a parallel run of the existing system for nearly two quarters, ensuring a smooth transition for market participants, the regulator said.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Sebi", "Sebi norms", "delisting", "Market regulator", "RRB process", ""], "date": "2024-09-26T23:29:36+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "124092600853", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:57"},

OpenAI said it has suffered damages in light of Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; actions and is seeking a jury trial.&nbsp;A lawyer for Musk didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;In the court fight Musk launched last year, he accused OpenAI of abandoning its founding purpose as a charity when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft Corp. starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI&rsquo;s board.&nbsp;A federal judge in Oakland, California, has set a March trial in Musk&rsquo;s challenge to Altman&rsquo;s plans to transform OpenAI from a nonprofit to a more conventional, public benefit for-profit company, setting the stage for a high-stakes clash between the two billionaires.&nbsp;In the counterclaims it filed Wednesday, OpenAI said the unsolicited February offer to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion by Musk and a coalition of deep-pocketed investors was a &ldquo;sham bid&rdquo; to thwart the startup&rsquo;s ability to raise funds and harm its relationships with investors and customers.&nbsp;Altman, OpenAI&rsquo;s chief executive officer, had spurned the buyout offer, saying OpenAI is &ldquo;not for sale,&rdquo; and his board rejected it, too.

The country should consider employing tariff quotas on sensitive food items such as (wheat and dairy), the paper said. India usually has large domestic surplus in wheat and dairy and though the paper did not say this explicitly, a tariff quota on the two items will ensure that domestic industry is not harmed and trade relations are not affected as well.&nbsp;&ldquo;India must simultaneously push the US for preferential market access on high-value Indian agri exports, such as mangoes, grapes, pomegranates, bananas which have long faced regulatory hurdles in the US, while streamlining our export supply chain,&rdquo; said the paper, which was co-written by Sulakshana Rao and Tanay Suntwal.&nbsp;With the right mix of diplomacy and economic strategy, India can strengthen its position in the US markets, even as the global trade order begins to shift. The paper called for diversifying India&rsquo;s agriculture exports markets away from the US towards regions like the European Union (EU).&nbsp;&ldquo;The EU, with 28.42 per cent of global imports, is a viable alternative. Fast tracking FTAs [free trade agreements] with the EU and even UK is key to staying competitive amid rising trade tensions,&rdquo; the paper said.&nbsp;Things are in flux and the impact of Trump&rsquo;s tariffs will be known in at least three to six to months. &ldquo;[The] Main point that we want to emphasise here is that India should not see the 26 per cent tariff in isolation, it must be assessed in relation to how India&rsquo;s competitors are affected. While India was levied an average additional tariff of 26 per cent, China was imposed a massive 54 per cent.&rdquo;&nbsp;This presents India with a strategic opportunity to occupy the space that China will likely vacate in key labour-intensive and export sectors, said the paper.&nbsp;As an example, the paper said in textiles (HSN codes 57, 61, 62 and 63), where India&#39;s exports to the US stood at $9.5 billion (2023), there is now a potential upside over the next few years if India can plug the gap left by China (54 per cent new US tariff levy), Bangladesh (37 per cent) and Vietnam (46 per cent).&nbsp;Besides agriculture, India enjoys a relatively better tariff position in machinery, smartphone, telecom, and networking; toys and games, leather, and footwear sector. &ldquo;Our research implies that India has a strategic opportunity to occupy the space that China will likely vacate in key labour-intensive and other export sectors. India&rsquo;s approach to Trump&rsquo;s reciprocal tariff move must be constructive and not combative. The bilateral talks [with the US] beginning next week should be forward looking towards Mission 500, i.e., more than doubling bilateral trade to USD500 billion by 2030,&rdquo; the paper said.&nbsp;India&rsquo;s largest agricultural export to the US is shrimp and prawn products, both in frozen (HSN 030617) and prepared/preserved (HSN 160521) forms.&nbsp;&ldquo;With a current 0-5 per cent tariff, Indian shrimp accounts for over 40 per cent market share in frozen and 27 per cent in prepared segments. However, under a reciprocal tariff regime, India&rsquo;s exports will attract 26 per cent duties, making them significantly costlier. In contrast, Ecuador, and Argentina benefit from 10 per cent tariffs, while Indonesia (32 per cent), Vietnam (46 per cent), and Thailand (36 per cent) face higher tariffs.&nbsp;&ldquo;While we do have cost competitiveness, the cost burden of tariffs gradually reduces our share especially in value-added segments.

The guidance takes effect immediately, according to the release.The announcement followed a notice last month about a Department of Homeland Security proposal to collect social media handles from people applying for benefits such as green cards or citizenship, to comply with an executive order from Trump. The public and federal agencies had until May 5 to provide feedback.The proposal notice raised alarms from immigration and free speech advocates because it appears to expand the government&#39;s reach in social media surveillance to people already vetted and in the US legally and not just those applying to enter the country.However, social media monitoring by immigration officials has been a practice for over a decade, since at least the second Obama administration and ramping up under Trump&#39;s first term.Wednesday&#39;s announcement does not say what would be considered as antisemitism or identify the educational institutions. USCIS did not respond immediately to an Associated Press request for information.Since Trump took office, there have been a growing number of attempted deportations against foreign-born students who joined pro-Palestinian protests or expressed criticism of Israel.Mahmoud Khalil, for example, was arrested last month and detained, with the administration saying it revoked his green card because his role in the campus protests amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas.The agency said it will consider social media content that indicates endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organisations, or other antisemitic activity as a negative factor when adjudicating immigration benefit requests.When describing extremists and terrorist aliens, USCIS refers to those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organisations&quot;.

It also coincides with climate superfund legislation gaining traction in various states.Trump has declared a national energy emergency and ordered his attorney general to take action against states that may be illegally overreaching their authority in how they regulate energy development.American energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities, Trump said in the order.He said the attorney general should focus on state laws targeting climate change, a broad order that unmistakably puts liberal states in the crosshairs of Trump&#39;s Department of Justice.Michael Gerrard, director of the Columbia University&#39;s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it would be an extraordinarily bold move for the federal government to go to court to try to overturn a state climate law.Gerrard said the quickest path for Trump&#39;s Department of Justice is to try to join ongoing lawsuits where courts are deciding whether states or cities are exceeding their authority by trying to force the fossil fuel industry to pay for the cost of damages from climate change.Democrats say they won&#39;t back downDemocratic governors vowed to keep fighting climate change.California Gov Gavin Newsom accused Trump of turning back the clock on the climate and said his state&#39;s efforts to reduce pollution won&#39;t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.New York Gov Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cochairs of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which includes 22 governors, said they will keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis.&quot;Climate superfund laws are gaining tractionVermont and New York are currently fighting challenges in federal courts to climate superfund laws passed last year. Trump suggested the laws extort payments from energy companies and threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.Both are modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law, which taxed petroleum and chemical companies to pay to clean up of sites polluted by toxic waste. In similar fashion, the state climate laws are designed to force major fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on their past greenhouse gas emissions.Several other Democratic-controlled states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and California, are considering similar measures.The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and natural gas industries, applauded Trump&#39;s order that it said would protect American energy from so-called climate superfunds.&#39;&nbsp;Directing the Department of Justice to address this state overreach will help restore the rule of law and ensure activist-driven campaigns do not stand in the way of ensuring the nation has access to an affordable and reliable energy supply,&quot; it said.Court battles are already ongoingThe American Petroleum Institute, along with the US Chamber of Commerce, filed the lawsuit against Vermont. The lawsuit against New York was filed by West Virginia, along with several coal, gas and oil interests and 21 other mostly Republican-led states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia.Make Polluters Pay, a coalition of consumer and anti-fossil fuel groups, vowed to fight Trump&#39;s order and accused fossil fuel billionaires of convincing Trump to launch an assault on states.The order, it said, demonstrates the corporate capture of government and weaponises the Justice Department against states that dare to make polluters pay for climate damage.Separately, the Department of Justice could join lawsuits in defense of fossil fuel industries being sued, Gerrard said.Those lawsuits include ones filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and dozens of cities and states seeking billions of dollars in damages from things like wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms.In the last three months, the US Supreme Court has declined to get involved in a couple climate-themed lawsuits.One was brought by oil and gas companies asking it to block Honolulu&#39;s lawsuit. Another was brought by Alabama and Republican attorneys general in 18 other states aimed at blocking lawsuits against the oil and gas industry from Democratic-led states, including California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.Trump&#39;s order set off talk in state Capitols around the US.That includes Pennsylvania, where the governor is contesting a court challenge to a regulation that would make it the first major fossil fuel-producing state to force power plant owners pay for greenhouse gas emissions.John Quigley, a former Pennsylvania environmental protection secretary and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, wondered if the Department of Justice would begin challenging all sorts of state water and air pollution laws.This kind of an order knows no bounds,&quot; Quigley said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to say where this could end up.", "keywords": ["Anthropocene", "Climate change", "Human impact on the environment", "Donald Trump", "Fossil fuel", "Energy development", "Climate change policy of the United States", "Environmental policy of the first Donald Trump administration", "Texas", "New Jersey", "West Virginia", "Vermont", "Ohio", "Minnesota", "planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution", "President", "University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center", "Alabama", "Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law", "high-tech manufacturing", "John Quigley", "energy dominance", "state climate law", "energy emergency", "oil and gas", "natural gas industries", "Oregon", "Hawaii", "energy supply", "american petroleum institute", "New York", "oil", "Gavin Newsom", "Department of Justice", "Connecticut", "U.S. Climate Alliance", "federal superfund law", "American Petroleum Institute", "energy", "energy production", "greenhouse gas emissions", "oil and gas industry", "US Supreme Court", "Governor", "federal government", "cloud computing applications", "artificial intelligence", "electricity demand ramps", "director", "the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy"], "date": "2025-04-10T10:12:26+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125041000215", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:58"},

He is considered the clear frontrunner in party&#39;s primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters Wednesday that he intends to run for president.Yoon&#39;s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party&#39;s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.In a video message, Lee said that Yoon&#39;s martial law saga exposed the country&#39;s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarisation.We have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas, Lee said.With economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.Lee said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea&#39;s national interest should come first in every decision.Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist. His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonizes conservative opponents while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals.Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of the People Power Party and a staunch Yoon loyalist, said that if Lee becomes president, he will ruthlessly wield the sword of dogmatism and retribution and further deepen the country&#39;s divisions.Lee also has his own set of legal troubles, facing five different trials for corruption and other criminal charges.Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon&#39;s impeachment by the legislature and formally removed him from office over the martial law decree, triggering a presidential by-election within 60 days. The next president will serve a full 5-year term.Former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, who heads the party&#39;s anti-Yoon faction, was expected to announce his presidential bid on Thursday. Among the conservatives&#39; presidential hopefuls, former Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo is considered to be the most pro-Yoon.Kim, Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo and senior PPP lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo a former computer software entrepreneur and three-time presidential candidate have declared their intentions to run for president.

The policy stance was also changed to &lsquo;accommodative&rsquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;First and foremost, uncertainty dampens growth by affecting investment and spending decisions of businesses and households. Second, the dent in global growth due to trade frictions will impede domestic growth,&rdquo; Malhotra said while announcing the monetary policy review and explaining the implications of trade-related tariffs.&nbsp;However, he said it would be difficult to quantify the impact of the tariffs, as several unknowns remain &mdash; such as the effect of relative tariffs, the elasticities of Indian export and import demand, and the policy measures adopted by the government, including the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US this fall.&nbsp;&ldquo;These make the quantification of the adverse impact difficult,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;At the same time, he noted that from India&rsquo;s perspective, the impact of these tariffs is relatively limited compared to other countries.&nbsp;He pointed out that India&rsquo;s exports account for about 12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the country&rsquo;s exposure to the US market is less than 2 per cent.

This gives us a comparative advantage in the context of US tariffs. However, it is true that overall, such tariff issues could dampen growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;When asked about a currency devaluation competition amid the tariff war, Malhotra said that if there is downward pressure on the rupee due to global factors, it would be allowed to adjust accordingly.

According to a&nbsp;CNBC&nbsp;report, the market regulator said it will review the constitution of a High-Level Committee (HLC) on conflict of interest, focusing on disclosures related to property, investments, and liabilities of board members to strengthen governance and transparency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HLC has been tasked with reviewing and strengthening the framework for managing conflicts of interest among board members, the report said.&nbsp; The objective is to improve transparency and governance standards within Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs). The committee is expected to submit its recommendations within three months of its formation.&nbsp; The disclosure of conflict of interest has gained significance in the wake of the controversy involving Pandey&rsquo;s predecessor, Madhabi Puri Buch, which surfaced after allegations made by now-shut US-based short-selling firm Hindenburg Research.&nbsp;Both Madhabi Puri Buch and Sebi have denied the allegations. Under existing rules, all Sebi board members and their spouses are required to disclose their assets to the market regulator. However, the norms, introduced in 2008, are not subject to stringent scrutiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;RAs/IAs can now collect a year&#39;s fee in advanceAnother big announcement made by Sebi board is that now registered research analysts (RAs) and investment advisors (IAs) can collect a year&#39;s fee in advance. So far, IAs were allowed to collect six months&#39; fee in advance and RAs were could collect advance fee for just one quarter.Appointment process for PIDs retainedAccording to CNBC report, Sebi has decided to retain the existing process for appointing Public Interest Directors (PIDs) at MIIs, requiring Sebi approval but not shareholder approval. MIIs must now record and submit reasons to Sebi if they choose not to reappoint an existing PID. Additionally, MIIs will set a minimum cooling-off period for key managerial personnel (KMPs) and Managing Directors before they can join a competing MII. However, Sebi will not mandate a cooling-off period for PIDs transitioning to other MIIs.&nbsp;Bureaucrat-turned-regulator Pandey took over as the Sebi chief on March 1.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Sebi", "Tuhin Kanta Pandey", "Sebi board meeting", "foreign portfolio investors", "FPIs", "FPI disclosure norms", "Rs 50000 crore AUM", "investment advisors", "research analysts", "Sebi conflict of interest", "Madhabi Puri Buch", "Hindenburg Research", "Sebi regulations", "Sebi new rules", "Sebi advance fee", "Sebi leadership", "Sebi FPI rules", "FPI taxation", "Sebi updates"], "date": "2025-03-24T17:34:41+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125032400894", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:58"},

British Steel has announced plans to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in Scunthorpe, a move that threatens up to 2,700 jobs and marks the end of more than 160 years of steel production in the town.&nbsp;The company, owned by China&rsquo;s Jingye Group, has cited financial losses of &pound;700,000 per day as well as economic pressures including tariffs and rising environmental costs. The decision has been met with strong criticism from trade unions, who have described it as &ldquo;devastating&rdquo;.&nbsp;The closure of Scunthorpe&rsquo;s furnaces follows a similar decision by Tata Steel to shut down its blast furnaces in Port Talbot, Wales. This would leave the UK as the only G7 country without the ability to produce steel from scratch using traditional methods.&nbsp;Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, warned that losing these facilities would severely impact national security, infrastructure, and construction sectors. &ldquo;This is an irreparable break in the armour of national security,&rdquo; he said as quoted by The Guardian.&nbsp;From industrial revolution to industrial decline&nbsp;The steel industry has long been central to Britain&rsquo;s economy. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the UK was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, pioneering advancements in iron and steel production. Innovations such as Henry Bessemer&rsquo;s steel-making process in the 1850s allowed Britain to dominate global steel production, fuelling railway expansion, shipbuilding, and the rise of industrial cities like Sheffield, Birmingham, and Manchester. However, in the 20th and 21st centuries, the industry has faced continuous decline.&nbsp;Why UK has become dependent on imported steel&nbsp;Once an industrial powerhouse, the UK has become increasingly reliant on imported steel, raising concerns over economic and strategic vulnerability. In 2023, net import of steel in the UK reached 4.6 million metric tons, accounting for a 60 per cent import share &mdash; up from 55 per cent the previous year, according to data by UK Steel. This import share went up even as overall imports fell by 5 per cent, partly due to higher volumes from countries like India and Vietnam, which benefit from lower electricity costs.&nbsp;According to the &lsquo;UK steel industry: Statistics and policy&rsquo; report presented before the House of Commons in March 2025, a combination of fierce international competition and high domestic costs has made many UK steel plants struggle to be competitive in a global market. It furssthser states that &ldquo;long-standing uncompetitive electricity prices have constrained UK investment and steel production for some time.&rdquo;&nbsp;The report also identifies Chinese overproduction among the reasons driving higher imports. China accounts for a massive share of global steel production &mdash; 54 per cent in 2023. Its steel output has increased dramatically over the past two decades, rising from 13 per cent of global production in 1995 to more than half now. This has resulted in a global surplus of steel, depressing prices internationally and making it difficult for UK producers to compete.&nbsp;A &lsquo;persistent and growing problem&rsquo; of global excess steel capacity, largely driven by Chinese overproduction and exports, has depressed global steel prices. This has made it harder for UK producers to compete, encouraging imports.&nbsp;Global and geopolitical pressures&nbsp;The crisis is worsened by international developments. The ongoing war in Ukraine has disrupted global supply chains and increased raw material costs, making steel production more expensive.&nbsp;Donald Trump&rsquo;s return to the White House hasn&rsquo;t helped the UK&rsquo;s cause either. The Trump administration recently re-imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel imports, reducing the competitiveness of British exports.&nbsp;What is the British government doing?&nbsp;The UK government had offered a &pound;500 million package to help British Steel transition to more environmentally friendly electric arc furnaces (EAFs). However, the Jingye Group rejected the deal, arguing that more investment &mdash; potentially up to &pound;1 billion &mdash; would be needed to complete the transition.&nbsp;Sarah Jones, the Energy Minister, stated that the government remains open to discussions. &ldquo;Our preferred approach is for British Steel to come back to the table and work towards private sector investment,&rdquo; she said. Nationalisation has not been ruled out, though it remains a politically contentious option.&nbsp;We must protect British Steel.&nbsp;If the Scunthorpe blast furnaces are closed down, they will not be recoverable.&nbsp;The steel industry would go into steep decline, with more people unemployed. All to import steel from China at a much higher cost. pic.twitter.com/6y6GtR4CkU&mdash; Bob Blackman (@BobBlackman) March 27, 2025&nbsp;In the meantime, with steel production declining, the UK risks being left without a domestic supply of raw steel, raising concerns over its ability to sustain industries reliant on high-quality steel products. The fate of the UK steel industry remains uncertain. While the transition to electric arc furnaces is being explored, it may not be completed for several years. In the interim, the UK will have to rely on imported steel, heightening worries about supply chain security and the loss of skilled jobs.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["british steel", "UK steel industry", "British Steel Scunthorpe closure", "UK steel crisis 2025", "steel plant shutdown UK", "UK steel imports", "Tata Steel Port Talbot closure", "China steel overproduction", "UK industrial decline", "steel job losses UK", "global steel market"], "date": "2025-03-31T18:07:17+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125033100625", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:25:59"},

Additionally, traditional energy sources like coal, oil, and gas will continue to see rising demand in India,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Investors can invest a minimum amount of \u20b9100 and any amount thereafter.

The inflation forecast for the financial year was also revised downwards to 4 per cent from 4.2 per cent earlier.&nbsp;A &ldquo;decisive improvement&rdquo; in the inflation outlook &mdash; projected to fall below the RBI&rsquo;s target of 4 per cent during 2025 &mdash; helped the central bank pivot towards supporting growth.&nbsp;Global uncertainties, particularly those driven by ongoing tariff conflicts, are expected to weigh on domestic growth, said RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, although he noted India&rsquo;s exposure to such risks would be limited.&nbsp;&ldquo;According to projections, there is now a greater confidence of a durable alignment of headline inflation with the target of 4 per cent over a 12-month horizon,&rdquo; he said while announcing the review of the first monetary policy of FY26.&nbsp;&nbsp;Malhotra further said: &ldquo;On the other hand, impeded by a challenging global environment, growth is still on a recovery path after an underwhelming performance in the first half of 2024-25.

Nonetheless, he stressed that liquidity management remained a key operational tool for monetary policy transmission. The RBI, he said, remained committed to ensuring adequate system liquidity.&nbsp;&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s change in stance from &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; to &lsquo;accommodative&rsquo; means that going forward, absent any shocks, the MPC is considering only two options &mdash; status quo or a rate cut,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Malhotra added that while he would like to see the transmission of the rate cut to lending and deposit rates happening swiftly, disrupting the system must also be avoided.&nbsp;With the repo rate cut, commercial banks are expected to lower retail lending rates, including home loan rates, as they are directly linked to the policy rate. Chennai-based Indian Bank announced a reduction in its repo-linked benchmark lending rate from 9.05 per cent to 8.70 per cent, with effect from April 11. Other lenders are expected to follow suit.&nbsp;However, deposit rates may take longer to adjust, as banks continue to face challenges in mobilising resources.&nbsp;&ldquo;The overall transmission to deposit rates has remained low as savings deposit rates have remained unresponsive to policy rate changes,&rdquo; said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic advisor, State Bank of India. &ldquo;Following the RBI&rsquo;s 25-basis-point repo rate cut in February, public-sector banks reduced deposit rates by 6 basis points, and foreign banks by 15 basis points; private banks increased rates by 2 basis points,&rdquo; Ghosh added.&nbsp;Unless deposit rates decline, banks&rsquo; marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) are unlikely to fall, as they remain closely tied to funding costs.

The first model, the SHG Bank Linkage Model, has become a movement and is presently a part of the National Rural Livelihood Mission, a poverty alleviation and employment programme of the government. The Joint Liability Groups, adopted by Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), is the second model, which is more prominent in our country&nbsp;Initially, the MFIs were promoted mostly by NGOs. However, as the model became popular and impactful, many investors came forward to invest in these institutions. At the same time, the regulator also encouraged these institutions to become NBFCs with RBI regulation. This helped these institutions attract investments from impact investors and PE companies, many of whom were based overseas. As a result, we have now vibrant microfinance institutions.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Microfinance stress continues to affect loan originations: CRIF data&nbsp;Presently, MFIs account for around 40 per cent of the portfolio while the remainder is shared by banks, SFBs and NBFCs. The overall portfolio touched Rs 4.4 trillion with around 85 million unique borrowers last year. However, by the end of the last financial year, it has come down to around Rs 3.8 trillion and 80 million borrowers.&nbsp;The microfinance sector has seen several ups and downs in its journey over the last two-and-a-half years. Since its clients are poor and vulnerable, the sensitivity around it is high and the slightest aberrations in lending practices can become news and invite the attention of many. We saw governmental interventions in Andhra Pradesh in 2010, Assam in 2020 and recently, in Karnataka. Any intervention by the administrators has a significant impact on the sector, both in terms of reputation and credit loss. We have also seen disruptions when external challenges like demonetisation of high value currencies or the Covid-19 pandemic happened. However, the beauty of this sector is that after every such crisis, the sector came back with more strength and better practices. The resilience of the microfinance sector has been seen every time it faced a challenge.&nbsp;One of the reasons for this resilience is the clientele it serves. Poorer people, who are financially excluded, struggle to raise credit from the formal system. Many times, they are also left to the mercies of usurious money lenders. This is where microlending institutions come to their rescue. Many of these MFIs are also involved in developmental activities which also benefit the borrower. Hence, around 80 million poor households are attached to microlending institutions for their needs.&nbsp;Microfinance, in the past one-and-a-half decades has shown remarkable growth, despite several challenges it faced, including demonetisation and Covid. The main reason behind this growth is the huge unmet demand at the bottom of the pyramid, which is being partially addressed by microfinance. According to an NCAER study, there is a microfinance potential of Rs 17 trillion by 2027. We have reached only a quarter of that. If we add the SHG bank linkage data also, it may be less than one-third of the projected potential. Hence, the loan outstanding of Rs 4 trillion is&nbsp; not surprising.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;NPLs in microfinance segment to peak by FY26 end: S&P Global Ratings&nbsp;The growth of microfinance after the Andhra crisis in 2010 has been nothing less than amazing. It grew from Rs 24,332 crore in 2011 to around Rs 3.80 trillion in the last financial year, a whopping 16 times. How did this growth happen? Several enabling ecosystems like credit bureaus providing credit data in real time, JAM trinity making digital transfer of funds, digitisation of loan sanction process from souring to loan disbursement and UPI supporting the digital payment and collections have been developed since then. These enabling ecosystems, along with the unmet credit demand, boosted the credit disbursement and growth of MFIs. It has been amply proved that recovery levels in microfinance has been always exemplary, including during Covid-19.&nbsp;The sector is once again facing some challenges in the last few months, due to over leverage and repayment stress. The fact is that the sectoral leaders realised the issue well in advance and took remedial steps along with SROs to address this issue. As a result, the damage has been reduced and the sector is on the path of recovery. In all probability, it will come back to its original shape in another one or two quarters.&nbsp;As the saying goes, &#39;microfinance can be loved or hated, but can&rsquo;t be ignored&#39;. It is the only source of credit to millions of households in our country and poor people realise this. As a result, they take care to abide by the terms of micro credit, including timely repayment. In the absence of this, a sector, which caters to more than 80 million households, would not have been successful, for the past several years.&nbsp;The author is the ED and CEO of Sa-Dhan, an SRO for MFIs.&nbsp;(Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the writer.

However, with the TEDBF expected to take at least a decade to materialise, the Rafale Marine jets will fill the gap in the interim.&nbsp;", "keywords": ["Rafale Marine", "Rafale M India", "Indian Navy fighter jets", "CCS Rafale deal", "INS Vikrant", "Rafale Marine purchase", "Dassault Aviation", "Indian Navy Rafale", "MiG-29K replacement", "Rafale offset package", "Rs 63000 crore defence deal", "India France defence agreement", "Rafale twin-seater", "Rafale for Navy", "IAF Rafale fleet"], "date": "2025-04-09T20:17:10+05:30", "media_house": "Business Standard", "article_id": "125040900640", "scraped_at": "2025-04-10 12:26:01"},
